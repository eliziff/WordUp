# pyOpenVBA Roadmap

This roadmap tracks pyOpenVBA's progress against the 26 hard gates defined in
[`xlsm_feature_completeness_gates.md`](xlsm_feature_completeness_gates.md).
Per-gate status keys:

- **PASS**: implemented; gate tests in [`tests/test_gates.py`](../tests/test_gates.py) pass.
- **PARTIAL**: minimum bar met; secondary assertions are `xfail`.
- **TODO**: not implemented; gate tests are `xfail(strict=True)`.
- **VERBATIM**: bytes are preserved through round-trip but not interpreted.
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: explicitly excluded from current development; tests are `skip` with a reason.

## Current scope declaration

pyOpenVBA reads and writes the VBA project of Excel, Word, PowerPoint and
Access files, and the design of their forms, with the same API on each
host. The gates below are the MS-OVBA gates the Excel work was built
against; the Access host is tracked phase by phase in
[`access_engine.md`](access_engine.md), whose table ends with what is
done and what is not.

### Supported
- `.xlsm`, `.xlsb`, `.xlam` (OOXML ZIP containers with `xl/vbaProject.bin`).
- `.docm`, `.dotm`, `.doc` and `.pptm`, `.potm`, `.ppt` through the same
  host pipeline.
- `.accdb` and `.mdb`: modules read and written, added, renamed and
  deleted; forms and reports read and edited; the same `pull` / `push`
  workflow (`pull_access`, `push_access`, `access-pull`, `access-push`).
- `.xls` (legacy BIFF8; vbaProject.bin is the entire file).
- Read all VBA module sources (standard, class, document, designer code-behind).
- Replace source of any existing module.
- **Disk-based push/pull** (`pyopenvba.pull` / `pyopenvba.push`, and
  `python -m pyopenvba {pull,push,ls}`): export modules to `.bas` / `.cls`
  files for use with any text editor / version control, then push edits back
  into the workbook.
- No-op round-trip preservation of every non-VBA ZIP entry.
- No-op round-trip preservation of every module's performance-cache prefix.
- **Creating and editing a UserForm's design surface**: the control
  tree, its nesting, each control's named properties, adding and
  removing controls, Frames, MultiPages and their pages, and composing
  a whole form from nothing (`host.add_form()`, `host.forms()`,
  `form.add_control()`, `form.add_page()`, `control.set_property()`,
  `python -m pyopenvba forms`).  Writing is lossless: an unedited form
  saves back byte for byte.
- Pure Python 3.10+, zero runtime dependencies.

### Unsupported (today)
- ActiveX license editing (PROJECTlk). ActiveX controls are deprecated; license bytes are round-tripped verbatim.
- Project password / protection editing (parsing-only; save refuses to mutate protected projects unless `allow_protected=True`).
- Digital signature re-signing (out of scope; stale signature streams are dropped on mutating save with a `UserWarning`).
- Office-compatible V3 / agile content-hash recomputation (a stable
  pyOpenVBA-internal digest is available via `compute_v3_content_hash`).
- Non-ASCII module identifiers (Excel's VBA IDE does not permit them; the parser nevertheless round-trips Latin-1 supplement names through cp1252).

## Gate-by-gate status

| Gate | Title | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| 0 | Scope Declaration | PASS | `ExcelFile` rejects unsupported hosts; CFB and VBA layers separated; `vba_project_bytes()` exposes raw `vbaProject.bin`. |
| 1 | Host Package | PASS | No-op + single-module-edit save preserves every other ZIP entry on both xlsm and xlsb. `xlsm` workbooks that have never had a VBA project initialised raise a structured `VBAProjectError` at open. "Opens in Excel without repair" is verified manually against the live corpus. |
| 2 | OLE/CFB Container | PASS | Reader + writer round-trip; case-insensitive lookup; `CFB.remove_stream` / `drop_streams_in_storage` / `rename_stream_in_storage` / `add_stream_to_storage` all rebuild the directory subtree; SRP streams are auto-dropped on `ExcelFile.save`. |
| 3 | Binary Parsing Discipline | PASS | Bounds-checked, signature-checked; `decompress()` carries `stream_name` + byte offset in `VBAProjectError` messages. |
| 4 | Compression / Decompression | PASS | Spec-compliant chunk-based codec; randomized round-trips up to 32 KB. |
| 5 | `_VBA_PROJECT` / Performance Cache | PASS | Module performance-cache prefix preserved verbatim across no-op writes. On any mutating save (add / rename / delete / source edit) the `_VBA_PROJECT` stream body is zeroed (5-byte header preserved) so Office regenerates the cache on next open ([MS-OVBA] 2.3.4.1: PerformanceCache MUST be ignored on read). Writers never emit `__SRP_*` streams. |
| 6 | PROJECT Stream | PASS | `parse_project_stream()` decodes the full plain-text grammar (project section, `[Host Extender Info]`, `[Workspace]`). `serialize_project_stream()` rewrites `Module=`/`Class=`/`BaseClass=`/`Document=` and `[Workspace]` keys to follow logical-name renames. |
| 7 | PROJECTwm | PASS | `parse_projectwm()` + `serialize_projectwm()` round-trip the live fixture byte-for-byte; `ExcelFile.save()` rebuilds `PROJECTwm` whenever the module set changes (add / rename / delete). |
| 8 | PROJECTlk | PASS | `parse_projectlk()` + `serialize_projectlk()` round-trip `LicenseInfoRecord`s; `ExcelFile.save()` preserves PROJECTlk bytes verbatim until ActiveX license editing is required. |
| 9 | dir Project Information | PASS | All PROJECTINFORMATION records decoded: code page, name, SysKind, LCID(invoke), DocString, HelpFile, HelpContext, LibFlags, Version, Constants, CompatVersion. |
| 10 | dir References | PASS | REFERENCENAME / REFERENCEREGISTERED / REFERENCEPROJECT / REFERENCECONTROL / REFERENCEORIGINAL records exposed as `VBAReference` entries on `VBAProject.references`. |
| 11 | dir Module Records | PASS | Module name (MBCS + Unicode), stream name (MBCS + Unicode), offset, type, read-only, private, doc-string (MBCS + Unicode), help-context, cookie all decoded. `serialize_dir_modules_section()` re-emits the full block. |
| 12 | Module Stream | PASS | Source decompressed from `MODULEOFFSET`; replacement preserves cache prefix; reparse yields identical source. |
| 13 | Module Mutation | PASS | Replace, add, rename, and delete all persist end-to-end (CFB stream create/rename/remove + dir rewrite + PROJECT rewrite). |
| 14 | Designer / UserForm | PASS | The designer streams are read, edited and written ([`forms.py`](../src/pyopenvba/forms.py)): control tree, nesting, named properties, control/container/page add and remove, and composing a form from nothing. Lossless is the gate -- an unedited form serializes to the bytes it was read from across every fixture, and a no-op save leaves all four designer child streams byte-for-byte identical. Verified against live Excel and live PowerPoint (`test_live_forms_gate.py`, `test_live_powerpoint_forms_gate.py`, opt-in). |
| 15 | Content Hash / Integrity | OUT OF SCOPE | `compute_v3_content_hash()` provides a stable SHA-1 digest over normalized module sources for internal use. The Office-compatible V3 / agile content hash (host-specific tokenization that matches Excel's signature payload) is intentionally out of scope; reaching parity would require Excel-side reference vectors and only matters for re-signing (also out of scope, see Gate 17). |
| 16 | Protection / Encryption / Password | PASS | `ProjectProtection` exposes raw obfuscated CMG/DPB/GC plus `has_password`. A real password-protected fixture (`workbook_with_password_protected_vba_modules.xlsm`) is parsed end-to-end. `ExcelFile.save()` refuses to mutate a protected project unless `allow_protected=True`; with the opt-in, the password material is preserved verbatim. Password decryption / re-encryption is intentionally out of scope. |
| 17 | Digital Signature | OUT OF SCOPE | `detect_signature()` identifies legacy / agile / V3 signature streams. `ExcelFile.save()` drops stale signature streams when the project is mutated and emits a `UserWarning` (silenced with `allow_invalidate_signature=True`). Re-signing modified projects with PKCS#7 / VBA digital signatures is intentionally out of scope. |
| 18 | Encoding | PASS | Latin-1 supplement module names + source round-trip end-to-end on a cp1252 project (`test_latin1_supplement_module_name_round_trip`). Non-cp1252 module identifiers are not exercised because Excel's VBA IDE does not permit them (out of scope). |
| 19 | Cross-Structure Consistency | PASS | `VBAProject.validate(cfb)` reports duplicates and missing streams. |
| 20 | Round-Trip Preservation | PASS | No-op parse-write-reopen preserves every module source, every ZIP entry, and every module-stream cache prefix. Manual Excel verification covers no-op, source-edit, add, rename, and delete on xlsm; no-op and source-edit on xlsb; and no-op + opt-in source-edit on the password-protected fixture (9/9 open in Excel with no repair dialog; see `scripts/build_excel_verification_set.py`). |
| 21 | Mutation Round-Trip | PASS | Replace-source, add, rename, and delete mutations all round-trip through save/reopen (parsed model, CFB streams, dir stream, and PROJECT stream all consistent). UserForm code-behind edits persist while the sibling designer sub-storage stays byte-for-byte identical (`test_replace_userform_code_behind_round_trip`). |
| 22 | Corpus | PASS | In-scope corpus complete: `test_macro_workbook.xlsm` (std + class + document + UserForm), `test_macro_workbook.xlsb` (binary host), `workbook_with_password_protected_vba_modules.xlsm` (password-protected), `xlsm_file_with_no_vba_entered_yet.xlsm` (no-VBA negative case). ActiveX, signed, and non-ASCII workbooks are explicitly out of scope. |
| 23 | Fuzz / Malformed Input | PASS | Truncated, zero-length, and random-byte inputs fail cleanly. Bit-flip fuzz harnesses exercise the CFB, dir, PROJECT, and PROJECTwm parsers (~120 mutated inputs per run, seeded for reproducibility). A persistent on-disk corpus lives at [`tests/fuzz_corpus/`](../tests/fuzz_corpus/) (~50 seeded inputs across `cfb/`, `decompress/`, `dir/`, `project/`, `projectwm/`); every file is replayed as a parametrized test (`test_persistent_fuzz_corpus`) and new regression seeds can be added by dropping files into the appropriate subdirectory. Regenerate / extend with `python scripts/seed_fuzz_corpus.py` (idempotent and additive). |
| 24 | API Contract | PASS | Layered modules: `pyopenvba.cfb`, `pyopenvba.vba`, `pyopenvba.excel`. Mutation surface (`add_module`/`rename_module`/`delete_module`) persists end-to-end through `save()`. |
| 25 | Documentation | PASS | `README.md` carries the scope statement, supported formats, push/pull workflow, and safety-guard summary; `docs/roadmap.md` tracks per-gate status. |

## Near-term roadmap (in priority order)

_No open near-term items: all in-scope gates are PASS. See the "Out of scope" section below for explicitly deferred work._

## Out of scope (no current plans)

- Re-signing modified projects with arbitrary PKCS#7 / VBA digital signatures (Gate 17).
- Office-compatible V3 / agile content-hash recomputation (Gate 15), only meaningful as a prerequisite for re-signing.
- Breaking, removing, or bypassing project protection passwords.
- Editing the design of a form whose streams this cannot parse: it raises
  rather than guessing, which is deliberate.
- Editing ActiveX licenses beyond preserving `PROJECTlk` verbatim.
- BIFF8 record-level editing of legacy `.xls` workbooks (only the embedded
  CFB / VBA project is supported; the workbook stream is treated as opaque).

## Files to keep up to date

When any structural change lands, update:

- `docs/roadmap.md` (this file).
- `tests/test_gates.py` (remove `xfail` markers as gates become PASS).
- `README.md` scope statement.
- The "Current scope declaration" section above.
