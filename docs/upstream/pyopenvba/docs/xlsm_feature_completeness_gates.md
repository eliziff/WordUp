# MS-OVBA Feature-Completeness Gates

An implementation is NOT feature-complete unless every HARD gate below passes.

If any gate is intentionally unsupported, the implementation must advertise itself as a
subset, for example:

- "VBA module extractor only"
- "VBA module source replacer only"
- "MS-OVBA reader with limited writer"
- "No UserForm/designer support"
- "No protected project/password/hash support"

Do not call the implementation "feature complete" unless all HARD gates pass.

---

## GATE 0: Scope Declaration Gate

HARD PASS requires:

- The implementation explicitly declares its supported host file formats.
- The core implementation can operate directly on a raw `vbaProject.bin`.
- For `.xlsm`, it can locate, extract, modify, and reinsert `/xl/vbaProject.bin`.
- For unsupported hosts such as `.docm`, `.pptm`, `.xlsb`, or legacy `.xls`, the implementation fails with a clear "unsupported host container" error.
- The implementation distinguishes between:
  - Office package handling
  - OLE/CFB handling
  - MS-OVBA project handling
  - VBA source text handling

Failure condition:

- The implementation only handles exported `.bas`, `.cls`, or `.frm` files and claims to support MS-OVBA.

---

## GATE 1: Host Package Gate

For `.xlsm` support, HARD PASS requires:

- Opens the Office Open XML ZIP package without corrupting unrelated workbook parts.
- Locates the VBA project part correctly.
- Preserves workbook XML, relationships, content types, media, custom properties, and unrelated package parts.
- Replaces only the intended VBA project binary unless explicitly asked to modify more.
- Output workbook opens in Excel without a repair dialog.
- Macros remain visible in the VBA editor after save/open.

Failure condition:

- Excel reports repaired records, removed macros, invalid content types, broken relationships, or inaccessible VBA project.

---

## GATE 2: OLE/CFB Container Gate

HARD PASS requires:

- Reads and writes `vbaProject.bin` as an OLE Compound File Binary container.
- Handles storages and streams case-insensitively where required.
- Correctly locates the Project Root Storage.
- Correctly locates the `VBA` storage.
- Correctly locates required streams:
  - `PROJECT`
  - `VBA/_VBA_PROJECT`
  - `VBA/dir`
  - every module stream named by `MODULESTREAMNAME`
- Correctly handles optional streams/storages:
  - `PROJECTwm`
  - `PROJECTlk`
  - designer storages
  - `VBFrame`
- Ignores SRP streams on read.
- Does not emit SRP streams on write.
- Preserves unknown/unmodified streams unless the spec requires removal.

Failure condition:

- The implementation treats `vbaProject.bin` as flat bytes or assumes module text is directly visible.

---

## GATE 3: Binary Parsing Discipline Gate

HARD PASS requires:

- All numeric fields are parsed with correct byte order.
- All record IDs, sizes, reserved fields, and terminators are validated.
- Reads are bounds-checked.
- Malformed streams fail cleanly.
- Unknown/reserved values are preserved when possible.
- Parser does not silently resynchronize after corruption unless explicitly operating in recovery mode.
- Every parse error includes stream name, offset, expected field, and actual value.

Failure condition:

- The parser guesses structure after a failure and continues as if valid.

---

## GATE 4: Compression/Decompression Gate

- Implements MS-OVBA compressed container decompression.
- Implements MS-OVBA compressed container compression.
- Handles raw chunks.
- Handles compressed chunks.

- Handles token sequences.
- Handles literal tokens.
- Handles copy tokens.
- Correctly computes copy-token offset and length.
- Correctly handles 4096-byte decompressed chunk boundaries.
- Correctly handles empty and boundary-sized streams.
- Passes the spec examples:
  - no compression
  - normal compression
  - maximum compression
- `decompress(compress(bytes)) == bytes` for a large randomized corpus.
- `compress(decompress(existingCompressed))` produces a valid stream accepted by Excel, even if bytes are not identical.

Failure condition:

- The implementation can decompress but cannot recompress valid output.

---

## GATE 5: `_VBA_PROJECT` / Performance Cache Gate

HARD PASS requires:

- Parses `_VBA_PROJECT` enough to determine version-dependent project information.
- Does not rely on performance caches for semantic data.
- Ignores performance caches on read.
- Writes interoperable output that forces Office to ignore stale performance caches.
- Removes or invalidates stale cache streams when required.
- Ensures stale module performance cache bytes do not override updated source.

Failure condition:

- Replaced source appears correct in the binary but Excel/VBE shows old code because a stale cache was honored.

---

---

## GATE 8: `PROJECTlk` / ActiveX License Gate

HARD PASS requires:

- Detects `PROJECTlk` when present.
- Parses license information sufficiently to preserve it.
- Does not destroy ActiveX licensing information during round-trip.
- If writing/modifying ActiveX-related project data, updates `PROJECTlk` consistently.

Each mutation must update all affected structures:

- CFB stream names

The implementation must expose a `validateProject()` or equivalent operation that reports all inconsistencies.

Failure condition:

- The writer emits a file without first validating cross-structure consistency.

---

## GATE 20: Round-Trip Preservation Gate

HARD PASS requires a no-op round trip:

The output must satisfy:

- Excel opens without repair.
- VBA project opens in VBE.
- All modules are present.

- All UserForms are present.
- All ActiveX controls remain present.
- Code compiles.

# Final Feature-Complete Rule

The implementation can be called "MS-OVBA feature complete" only if:

1. All hard gates pass.
2. Real Excel opens every generated file without repair.
3. VBE shows the expected project structure.
4. VBA source compiles.
5. No-op round trips preserve semantics.
6. Mutating source updates every dependent structure.
7. Unsupported edge cases fail closed with explicit diagnostics.
8. The test corpus includes modules, classes, document modules, UserForms, references, protection, signatures, non-ASCII names, and malformed files.

Otherwise, describe the implementation by its actual subset.

Examples:

- "MS-OVBA module extractor"
- "MS-OVBA module source reader/writer"
- "Partial MS-OVBA writer without UserForms"
- "VBA project binary round-tripper with source replacement"
