# Power Query in an Excel workbook

How Excel stores Get and Transform queries, and what pyOpenVBA writes.

Every statement below was measured, not read off a specification. Two
oracles were used, and each fact says which one settled it:

* **Live Excel**, through `pyvbaharness`: build a workbook, open it, ask
  the object model what it sees, and have the mashup engine evaluate a
  query. This is what says a written package works.
* **Microsoft's own packaging assemblies**, which ship beside Excel in
  `ADDINS\Microsoft Power Query for Excel Integrated\bin`. Loading
  `Microsoft.Mashup.Client.Packaging.dll` in PowerShell and calling
  `PackageMetadataSerializer`, `QueriesMetadataSerializer` and
  `SerializedMetadataEntry` gives the exact bytes Excel's own code would
  write for a given input. This is what settled the encodings, and the
  golden values in `tests/test_powerquery_metadata.py` came out of it.

## Where it lives

The whole project sits in one custom XML part, `customXml/itemN.xml`,
written in UTF-16 with a byte-order mark:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-16"?>
<DataMashup xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/DataMashup">BASE64</DataMashup>
```

The element sometimes carries an `sqmid` attribute, so the wrapper is
kept as it was found.

A workbook that has never held a query needs four more things before the
part means anything, and pyOpenVBA writes all of them:

| Part | What it carries |
| --- | --- |
| `customXml/itemPropsN.xml` | `ds:datastoreItem` with a schema reference to the DataMashup namespace |
| `customXml/_rels/itemN.xml.rels` | the item's pointer at its properties |
| `[Content_Types].xml` | an Override for the properties part; the item itself rides the `xml` Default |
| `xl/_rels/workbook.xml.rels` | a `customXml` relationship to the item |

Nothing else is needed for queries that only hold a connection (measured
against workbooks Excel wrote, and against a workbook built here from
one that had no Power Query at all).

---

## The blob

Five pieces, each after the first behind a length:

```
u32 version (0)
u32 length + the OPC package
u32 length + the permission list (XML)
u32 length + the metadata section
u32 length + the permission bindings
```

Measured with live Excel, by emptying one piece at a time:

* **The permission list is required.** Empty it and Excel opens the
  workbook with an error instead of its queries.
* **The metadata's content package is required.** Cut the metadata short
  of it and the same thing happens.
* **The bindings are not required.** They hold a signature protected by
  the Windows data-protection API, tied to the machine that wrote them.
  Excel opens and refreshes a workbook whose bindings are empty, so
  pyOpenVBA drops them when it changes the package: a signature that no
  longer covers what it signs is worse than none.

**Excel does not rewrite the blob when it saves a workbook it did not
edit.** A blob written here comes back byte for byte after Excel opens
and saves the file. So the writer aims at Excel's own bytes, not
merely at bytes Excel tolerates.

### The package

An OPC ZIP with three parts, in this order: `Config/Package.xml`,
`[Content_Types].xml`, `Formulas/Section1.m`.

Excel writes it with settings of its own, and pyOpenVBA reproduces them:

* raw deflate at **level 6** with the default memory level. Level 6 is
  the only level that explains every entry measured: a 1075-byte section
  rules out 7 and above, and a 73 KB one rules out 5 and below.
* general-purpose flag `0x0002`, version made by 45, version needed 20.
* a 28-byte Open Packaging growth hint (`0xA220`) on every local header
  and none in the central directory.

Rebuilding each fixture's package from its parts gives back Excel's
bytes exactly (`tests/test_powerquery_package.py`).

### Formulas/Section1.m

```
section Section1;<CRLF><CRLF>
[ Description = "what it does" ]<CRLF>     (only when there is one)
shared Name = <expression>;<CRLF><CRLF>
...
shared Last = <expression>;                (no newline at the end)
```

CRLF throughout. A name that is not a plain identifier is written
`#"Like This"`.

### The metadata section

```
u32 version (0)
u32 length + the XML (UTF-8, with a byte-order mark)
u32 length + a content package (an empty ZIP, 22 bytes)
```

The XML is a `LocalPackageMetadataFile` listing one `Item` per formula:

```xml
<Item>
  <ItemLocation><ItemType>Formula</ItemType>
    <ItemPath>Section1/Order%20Lines</ItemPath></ItemLocation>
  <StableEntries><Entry Type="IsPrivate" Value="l0" /></StableEntries>
</Item>
```

* The first item is `AllFormulas`, with an empty path. It carries what
  belongs to the whole document: the query groups, and the switches for
  relationship and type detection.
* **A query is an item with at least one entry.** An item whose
  `StableEntries` is empty is a step. This was measured: a `shared`
  member added with an entry-less item left Excel showing three queries,
  and any single entry was enough to make the fourth appear.
* **A member with no item is worse than useless.** Excel fails to open
  the queries at all ("the index is out of bounds"), so the two halves
  are always written together.
* Steps come from the **top-level** `let` bindings, one item each,
  immediately after the query's own item. A nested `let` contributes
  nothing, an expression that is not a `let` gets no steps, and a
  function gets none either.
* Item paths are percent-encoded by .NET's `Uri.EscapeDataString` rules:
  `A-Za-z0-9-._~!'()*` survive, everything else becomes `%XX` over UTF-8.

### Entry values

The first character is the type, from Microsoft's `SerializedMetadataEntry`:

| Prefix | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `l` | 64-bit integer | `l0`, `l-7` |
| `f` | double, .NET's `G15` | `f1.5`, `f0.333333333333333`, `f1E+20` |
| `s` | text | `sConnectionOnly` |
| `c` | GUID | `c1111...` |
| `d` | timestamp | `d2026-09-05T13:45:12.2500000Z` |

Excel writes `QueryID` as a text entry, not a GUID one, and pyOpenVBA
does the same.

What a new query carries, exactly as Excel writes it: `IsPrivate` 0,
`FillEnabled` 0, `FillObjectType` `ConnectionOnly`,
`FillToDataModelEnabled` 0, `QueryID`, and `ResultType` `Function` when
the expression is a function.

`ResultType` is Excel's record of what a query *evaluated* to, not of how
it is written: Excel marks `each _ + 1`, `(x) => x` and
`let F = (x) => x in F` alike. The last cannot be told from the text
without running the query, so pyOpenVBA answers the syntactic question
and lets Excel correct the entry on its next refresh.

### Query groups

The folders in the Queries pane live in one entry on the `AllFormulas`
item, and the value is **not JSON**. It is Microsoft's own binary
serialization, base64-encoded:

```
u32 count
per group:
  u32 0
  16 bytes  Guid Id (.NET layout)
  string    Name          (7-bit-encoded length, UTF-8)
  string    Description   (never null; Excel writes "")
  u8        has parent, then 16 bytes Guid ParentId when set
  i32       Order
```

A query joins a group through its own `QueryGroupID` entry.

pyOpenVBA's writer is byte-identical to
`QueriesMetadataSerializer.SerializeQueryGroups` over 60 randomized
cases. Excel parses the value with the same reader: given a deliberately
corrupt one, it threw out of
`QueryGroupMetadataSet.Deserialize(BinarySerializationReader)` and could
not open the queries, while the valid one written here survived Excel's
own edit of the workbook untouched.

## Loading a query onto a sheet

The metadata says where a query loads, and **saying it changes nothing**:
a connection-only query marked `FillEnabled = 1`, `FillObjectType = Table`
opened in Excel, refreshed, and produced no table at all. Excel loads a
query only when the workbook also carries the objects that do it:

* a connection in `xl/connections.xml` through
  `Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1` with `Location=<query>` and
  `command="SELECT * FROM [<query>]"`,
* `xl/queryTables/queryTableN.xml` bound to that connection,
* `xl/tables/tableN.xml` with `tableType="queryTable"`,
* the sheet's `tableParts` entry and relationship, a header row, and a
  hidden `ExternalData_N` defined name.

`load_to_sheet()` writes all of it. The column names have to be supplied,
because working them out means evaluating the query and only the mashup
engine can do that; Excel reconciles them with the real result and fills
the rows on the first refresh.

`unload()` takes every piece back out. One rule there is easy to get
wrong: **a connections part holding no connections is one Excel refuses**,
so removing the last connection removes the part, its content type and
its relationship as well.

The hidden name has three rules of its own, and each was learned the
hard way:

* **`localSheetId` is the zero-based position of the sheet the name
  belongs to** among the workbook's sheets, not a constant, and it has to
  agree with the sheet the reference names. Written as 0 it was right
  only while the table landed on the first sheet; anywhere else Excel
  refuses to open the workbook, which a one-sheet file cannot show.
* **A sheet name inside a reference is quoted unless it is a plain
  identifier**, and an apostrophe within it is doubled: `It's` is spelled
  `'It''s'`. A single apostrophe closes the quoting early and the
  reference names something else. A name opening with a digit is quoted
  too, since unquoted it reads as part of a cell reference.
* **A sheet name is stored XML-escaped**, so `A & B` sits in the file as
  `A &amp; B`. Reading the stored form as if it were the name meant that
  asking for the sheet by the name it actually has found nothing.
  Attribute values are decoded on the way in and escaped again on the way
  out.

### Refresh control

The boxes in Excel's Connection Properties dialog belong to that
connection too, and to the query table beside it. Where each one is
written was measured by toggling it through Excel's object model and
diffing the file:

| Dialog | Written as |
| --- | --- |
| Enable background refresh | `connection/@background`, mirrored as `queryTable/@backgroundRefresh="0"` when off |
| Refresh every N minutes | `connection/@interval` |
| Refresh data when opening the file | `connection/@refreshOnLoad`, mirrored on the query table |
| Remove data before saving | `queryTable/@removeDataOnSave`, with `connection/@saveData` dropped |
| Refresh this connection on Refresh All | `x15:connection/@excludeFromRefreshAll` inside the connection's `extLst`, under the extension uri `{DE250136-89BD-433C-8126-D09CA5730AF9}` |
| Enable refresh | `queryTable/@disableRefresh` |

Every one of them is absent by default and absent means off, so turning a
setting off is written by taking the attribute away. Two of them are not
where the dialog's wording suggests. The one about removing data reads
from the query table, not from the connection's `saveData`, which is why
setting `saveData` alone left Excel still reporting that data would be
kept. And staying out of Refresh All is stored the other way round, as an
exclusion.

**The dialog's own wiring is not a rule about the file.** Excel greys
"Remove data ... before saving the workbook" out until "Refresh data when
opening the file" is ticked, which makes `removeDataOnSave` without
`refreshOnLoad` look like a state only a writer outside Excel could
produce. It is not. Three measurements say so:

* Excel's object model sets `QueryTable.SaveData = False` with
  refresh-on-open off and raises nothing, reading the property back as
  `False`.
* Excel writes the pair itself. Tick refresh-on-open, tick remove-data,
  then untick refresh-on-open, and Excel saves `removeDataOnSave="1"`
  with no `refreshOnLoad` on either part.
* Excel opens a workbook pyOpenVBA wrote that way, reports the setting
  correctly, and saves it back with the attribute intact.

So `keep_data = False` on its own is a state Excel keeps. The dialog
renders it as a ticked box greyed out beneath an unticked one, because
unticking the parent disables the child without clearing it. The
practical effect is a query whose rows are dropped on save and never
fetched again on their own, so the table opens empty until someone
refreshes it.

`query.refresh` gives these as `background`, `interval_minutes`,
`on_open`, `keep_data`, `in_refresh_all` and `enabled`. The live gate
sets all six from Python and has Excel's object model read them back.

**"Enable Fast Data Load" is not covered.** Excel's object model does not
expose it, so there was no way to watch Excel write it, and the rest of
this file exists because nothing here is written on a guess.

## Workbooks another tool wrote

Excel is not the only writer of `.xlsx`, and the parts it produces are
one legal spelling among several. Three assumptions here came from
reading only Excel's output, and each one broke on openpyxl's:

* **Attribute order carries no meaning.** Excel opens a relationship with
  `Id`, openpyxl closes with it. Matching in a fixed order found nothing,
  so a sheet looked as though it had no part behind it and loading to it
  failed outright.
* **An empty element may be written closed.** `<definedNames />` is the
  same element as `<definedNames></definedNames>`. Appending a second
  block beside it left two in the workbook, which Excel refuses.
* **A namespace prefix is declared where it is used.** Excel puts
  `xmlns:r` on every worksheet; openpyxl puts it on a worksheet that
  needs one, and a sheet with no table does not. Adding a `tablePart`
  that used the prefix made the part not well formed.

Loading a query onto a sheet of a workbook openpyxl wrote works, and
Excel opens and refreshes the result.

**The other direction does not, and cannot be fixed here.** openpyxl
rebuilds the package from the parts it models and drops the rest, custom
XML included, so saving a workbook through it removes the Power Query
package and the queries with it. Nothing signals this: the file opens and
simply has no queries. Put pyOpenVBA last in the pipeline, or carry the
queries across with `pull_queries()` and `push_queries()`.

## `[trash]` parts

Excel's own file recovery leaves the parts it threw out under
`[trash]/NNNN.dat`, beside the real ones. An OPC part name cannot open a
segment with a bracket, and Excel holds itself to that when reading: the
same workbook opens before such an entry is added and fails to open at
all after, measured both ways.

The container preserves every entry as it arrived, which would hand back
a file that stays broken, so `save()` drops these and warns. Nothing in
the document depends on them: they carry no content type and no
relationship points at them.

## What Excel refuses

* A query name containing a dot. `Queries.Add` rejects it with
  `0x80070057`, so a workbook should not carry one either.

## What is not covered

* Loading to the data model. The connection for it is a different shape,
  and the model itself is a separate store.
* Evaluating M. Nothing here runs a query; that is the engine's job.
* Credentials and privacy levels beyond the permission list, which is
  written as Excel writes it for a workbook whose queries hold none.
