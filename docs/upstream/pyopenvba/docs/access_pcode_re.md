This document accretes findings from the multi-session effort to fully
understand the `.accdb` VBA storage format so that pyOpenVBA can perform
structural writes (add/rename/remove modules, change source) on Access
databases without invoking Office COM.

## Goal

Pure-Python, dependency-free, bidirectional read/write parity for VBA
inside `.accdb` files, matching what `pyopenvba.excel`, `pyopenvba.word`
and `pyopenvba.powerpoint` already deliver for OOXML containers.

## What is already shipped (read + same-length plaintext write)

* `AccessFile` reads OVBA-compressed module source via the LVAL-page
  chain walker (`_lval_segments`, `_read_lval_chain`,
  `_find_ovba_signature_offsets`). Parity with the COM oracle is
  verified on the canonical fixture.
* `AccessFile.replace_text` performs same-length, in-place plaintext
  patches against the authoritative `E3 00 00 00 <u16 len> <ascii>`
  comment-row table and `B9 00 <u16 len> <ascii> <12B trailer>`
  literal-row table. Verified end-to-end against the live VBA editor.
* `AccessFile.save` writes the in-memory mutated bytes back to disk.

## What is NOT yet supported (the open problem)

Structural changes:

* add module
* remove module
* rename module
* arbitrary-length source change (length-mismatched source replacement)

Each of those requires Access's symbol/name table, p-code table, OVBA
catalog and (for length changes) the per-page B-tree of the LVAL store
to be rewritten consistently. None of those tables are documented.

We confirmed earlier in the project that the per-module OVBA blob is a
**passive cache** -- Access reads its compiled p-code from a separate,
authoritative byte region. Force-recompile attempts (zero OVBA + zero
per-module compile-cache 4-tuple) did NOT cause Access to recompile
from OVBA. The p-code tables are therefore the real target.

## Storage layout (current understanding)

Each `.accdb` that contains a VBA project stores the full project state
in a single long-value (LVAL) record. The record's payload is structured
as a concatenation of:

1. **Plaintext PROJECT file** -- the same line-based format Excel/Word/
   PowerPoint ship in their CFB `PROJECT` stream:
   ```
   ID="{<guid>}"
   Module=<head module name>
   Name="<project name>"
   HelpContextID="0"
   VersionCompatible32="393222000"
   CMG="..."
   DPB="..."
   GC="..."

   [Host Extender Info]
   &H00000001={3832D640-CF90-11CF-8E43-00A0C911005A};VBE;&H00000000

   [Workspace]
   <ModuleName>=38, 38, 4512, 1443, Z
   ```
2. **Binary catalog / symbol-table region.** Undocumented. This is the
   primary target of the RE corpus diff work.
3. **One MS-OVBA-compressed stream per module**, beginning with the
   canonical
   `Attribute VB_Name = "<name>"\r\nOption Compare Database\r\n<body>`.
4. **Plaintext source-row tables** -- `B9 00 <u16 len> <ascii> <12B
   trailer>` for string literals, `E3 00 00 00 <u16 len> <ascii>` for
   comments. These are the bytes `AccessFile.replace_text` already
   mutates.

The LVAL record is stored across one or more LVAL pages (page type
`0x01`, tag `LVAL` at +4). Each LVAL page may hold chunks of multiple
distinct long-value records, indexed by a per-row slot table that
begins at page offset 14. The continuation pointer for a given chunk
is a `(page, slot)` tuple stored at the tail of the row, NOT a single
page-level next-pointer in the page header. **This row format is not
yet decoded** -- it is the first blocker for any multi-page chain
reassembly.

## Phased plan

### Phase 1 -- corpus + tooling (DONE this session)

* `tests/live_access_test/_corpus_generate.ps1` -- COM-driven corpus
  generator. Produces `baseline_empty.accdb`, `baseline_empty_proj.accdb`
  and 25 minimal samples (IDs 010..051) covering: empty StdModule with
  varying names, empty ClassModule, single empty Sub, single statements
  (MsgBox/Dim/Let/comment), basic If/For. Output lives in
  `tests/live_access_test/re_corpus/` (gitignored).
* `scripts/_diff_accdb.py` -- page-aware byte diff with page-type
  tagging.
* `scripts/access_re_chain.py` -- locates the project-VBA LVAL head
  page by the `ID="{` plaintext fingerprint, extracts the head-page
  payload slice, splits it into known section types and dumps it.

### Phase 2 -- LVAL row format (DONE 2026-05)

Reverse-engineered the per-row layout so the multi-page chain can be
walked deterministically and module discovery works on arbitrary
.accdb files (verified on all 25 corpus samples + canonical fixture).

LVAL page layout (4 KiB pages):

* `[0]`        `page_type = 0x01`
* `[4:8]`      `'LVAL'` tag
* `[12:14]`    u16 LE slot count `N`
* `[14:14+2N]` u16 LE slot table. Top nibble `0xD` = tombstone; else
  the low 12 bits are the row's byte offset within the page.
* Rows grow downward from `PAGE_SIZE`. A row ends at the smallest
  higher non-tombstone slot offset, or `PAGE_SIZE` for the top row.

Long-value chunk continuation prefix (present only on chained rows):

* `row[0]`   u8 next_slot
* `row[1:4]` u24 LE next_page
* `row[4:]`  chunk payload
* Terminator: `(next_slot, next_page) == (0, 0)`.

A long-value that fits in one chunk is stored standalone -- the row IS
the payload, with NO continuation prefix. Standalone vs chain-head is
not encoded in the row itself; the working heuristic is "treat
`row[1:4]` as a page number; if it's in range AND points to another
LVAL page, walk it as a chain, otherwise treat as standalone."

Implementation: `pyopenvba.access.AccessFile.iter_vba_modules` walks
every non-tombstone LVAL row, scans for MS-OVBA stream signatures
(`0x01` followed by a u16 LE chunk header with sig bits `0b011`),
and accepts any candidate that decompresses to a stream beginning
with `Attribute VB_Name = "..."`.

### Phase 3 -- symbol/catalog table (DONE 2026-05)

**Finding: there is no Access-specific symbol-table format. The
"binary catalog" is just an MS-OVBA `dir` stream (MS-OVBA section
2.3.4.2) OVBA-compressed in a single LVAL row.**

In every corpus sample examined, exactly one LVAL row OVBA-decompresses
to bytes starting with the PROJECTSYSKIND record header
`01 00 04 00 00 00`. That row contains the full standard dir-stream
TLV record sequence:

* PROJECTSYSKIND / PROJECTLCID / PROJECTLCIDINVOKE / PROJECTCODEPAGE
* PROJECTNAME (`baseline_empty_proj` in the empty-project corpus)
* PROJECTVERSION (special-cased: no real size field; 10-byte payload)
* PROJECTREFERENCES -- `stdole` plus `DAO` (ACEDAO.DLL) are standard
* PROJECTMODULES blocks: MODULENAME / MODULENAMEUNICODE /
  MODULESTREAMNAME (a mangled obfuscated identifier; Access does not
  use it as a real stream name since there is no CFB) /
  MODULEDOCSTRING / MODULEOFFSET / MODULETYPE
  (0x0021 = procedural, 0x0022 = class) / MODULEREADONLY /
  MODULEPRIVATE / module terminator 0x002B
* Dir-stream terminator 0x0010

The catalog row's slot index is **not** stable across files (010..015
put it at (68, 1); class-module sample 020 places it at (68, 2)). We
locate it by content -- decompress every LVAL row and accept the one
whose decompressed prefix is `01 00 04 00 00 00`.

Production wiring (`AccessFile.read_project_info`) reuses
`pyopenvba.vba.parse_dir_stream` directly (same parser that drives the
Excel/Word/PowerPoint paths). `vba_module_names()` now prefers the
catalog's authoritative ordered list when available, falling back to
the OVBA-scan path only if the catalog row cannot be located.

Deliverable: DONE. Byte-precise documentation lives in MS-OVBA
section 2.3.4.2; the parser in `pyopenvba/vba.py:parse_dir_stream`
handles all currently observed records. Reference-record decoding
(beyond the standard `registered` kind) and write-back (catalog
mutation when modules are added/removed/renamed) are still pending and
fall under Phase 5.

### Phase 4 -- p-code opcode field guide

**Status (May 2026): row location SOLVED; opcode decoding IN PROGRESS.**

The compiled VBA bytecode lives in LVAL rows whose payload starts with
the 4-byte magic `72 55 40 00` ('rU@\0'). Every Access database with VBA
enabled carries 2-3 such rows; exactly one of them is the
**module-active** row that Access executes. The deterministic structural
discriminator is the 12-byte prefix

    72 55 40 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 00

i.e. byte at offset 10 is `0x40` for active and `0x00` for stale /
bootstrap rows. Verified across the 15-sample corpus.

Production API:

* `AccessFile.read_module_pcode_stream() -> AccessVBAPCodeStream`
* `AccessFile.iter_pcode_streams() -> tuple[AccessVBAPCodeStream, ...]`
* `AccessVBAPCodeStream(page, slot, raw)` dataclass
* `AccessFile.find_interned_strings() -> tuple[AccessVBAInternedString, ...]`
  -- deterministic content-based scan of the project intern table
* `AccessVBAInternedString(page, slot, offset, value)` dataclass

Slot location is NOT stable -- 030 stores the active row at (68, 0);
040..051 store it at (68, 1). Locate by content only.

Established structural facts (locked in by
`tests/test_access.py::test_pcode_*`):

* Active-row 12-byte prefix discriminator (one match per database).
* Corpus baseline row lengths (drift detection).
* Same length for `Sub A() / End Sub`, `Dim x As Integer`,
  `Dim x As Long`, `' a comment` (all 269 bytes) -- a fixed-size
  skeleton with slotted declarations.
* `Dim x As Integer` vs `Dim x As Long` differ at exactly offset
  `0x8C` (1 byte: the per-type token: Integer=`0x6E`, Long=`0x53`).
* Byte at offset `0x98` = local-vars table size in bytes (0x00 with
  no `Dim`, 0x08 with a single declared scalar local of any type).
* Comments are NOT in p-code: sample 030 (empty Sub) is byte-for-byte
  identical to sample 049 (`' a comment` body). Comment text lives in
  the separate plaintext `E3 00 00 00 <len> <ascii>` rows.
* **Procedure names are NOT in p-code.** `Sub A()`, `Sub B()`, and
  `Sub AB()` (different letters AND different name lengths) all
  produce *byte-for-byte identical* 269-byte p-code streams.
  Procedure names live in the project catalog / dir-stream and are
  referenced from bytecode purely by slot id.
* **Module names are NOT in p-code.** All empty standard modules
  (`M`, `AB`, `ABC`, `Mod1`, `Module1`, `ThisIsALongModuleName`)
  produce identical 126-byte p-code streams.

This triad -- comments, procedure names, module names, plus the
separately-interned string literals -- means the compiled p-code is
**fully anonymised**: it contains opcodes and slot references but no
user-authored text. All identifiers live in the catalog / symbol
tables and can be patched independently of the bytecode.

Decoded opcodes (deterministic; all asserted by regression tests):

| Mnemonic           | Bytes              | Operand                    | Source evidence            |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| ProcOpen / ProcEnd | `67 02`            | -                          | brackets every Sub body    |
| ProcTrailer        | `7B 02 <u32 LE>`   | proc cookie (length-rel.)  | exactly 1 per active row   |
| Push i16 imm       | `ED 05 <i16 LE>`   | integer literal LE         | sample 048 `x = 42`        |
| Push i16 (True)    | `ED 05 FF FF`      | -1 (canonical True)        | sample 050 `If True Then`  |
| Push small imm     | `77 06`            | embedded                   | sample 047 `x = 7`         |
| Store local        | `B1 02 <i32 LE>`   | FBP offset (1st local=-8)  | samples 047, 048           |
| Load local         | `9F 02 <i32 LE>`   | FBP offset                 | sample 051 (`i` in For)    |
| For-Init           | `71 06`            | -                          | sample 051                 |
| For-Step / Next    | `73 06`            | -                          | sample 051                 |
| BranchIfFalse      | `C7 02 <u32 LE>`   | forward jump target        | sample 050 `If True Then`  |
| LoadAddress local  | `F1 01 <i32 LE>`   | FBP-relative slot addr     | sample 040 (MsgBox arg)    |
| Call-block open    | `67 02 4C 00 00 00`| -                          | sample 040 (MsgBox call)   |
| Call dispatch      | `<u16 stmt#> 49 06 <i32 LE>`| 1-based stmt index + FBP-rel target | samples 040, 043 |
| ProcEnd close      | `67 02 00 00 00 00`| -                          | every Sub body             |

Pending: full opcode table covering Sub/End Sub, Dim of complex
types, If/Then, For/Next, function call dispatch, variable references,
local-vars table layout, and the relationship between the active row,
the 156-byte stub row, and the ~114-byte project bootstrap row.

### Phase 4b -- string-literal intern table (decoded)

VBA string literals are **not** stored inline in the p-code. They live
in a separate per-project intern table, in one of the database's LVAL
rows alongside the reference / module-metadata blob.

Record format (locked by regression tests on corpus samples 040, 041,
042, 043):

```
0B               -- literal tag (1 byte)
<u32 LE>         -- byte-count of the UTF-16-LE payload
<UTF-16-LE>      -- the string value, no NUL terminator
```

Examples observed on disk:

* `"hello"` -> `0B 0A 00 00 00 68 00 65 00 6C 00 6C 00 6F 00`
* `"world"` -> `0B 0A 00 00 00 77 00 6F 00 72 00 6C 00 64 00`
* 55-char literal -> `0B 6E 00 00 00 <110 bytes UTF-16-LE>`

Comments are *not* in this table (sample 049's `' a comment` exists
only as plain ASCII in a separate `E3 00`-tagged source-text row).

Production API: `AccessFile.find_interned_strings()` performs a
deterministic content-based scan -- it locates literal records by
their structural `0B <u32> <UTF-16-LE>` shape, with no hard-coded
row coordinates.

### Phase 4c -- ProcTrailer block layout (decoded)

Every Sub body ends with a fixed-shape trailer block immediately
following the `67 02 00 00 00 00` ProcEnd. The structure is:

```
7B 02 <u32 LE cookie>            -- ProcTrailer; cookie reproducible
                                    for identical bytecode, content-
                                    dependent (full algorithm pending).
00 00 00 00 00 00                -- six zero bytes
08 00                            -- fixed sentinel
<u16 LE frame_size>              -- = max FBP-relative local offset
<u16 LE body_size>               -- bytes from ProcOpen to ProcEnd
```

Frame-size observations:

* empty Sub (no locals) -> `00 00`
* `Dim x As Integer` (one scalar) -> `08 00`
* MsgBox 4-slot arg frame -> `C0 00`

Cookie observations (deterministic for identical bytecode):

* Body-identical samples 030 / 044 / 049 -> cookie `0x6E`
* `MsgBox "hello"` (040) -> cookie `0x30`; `MsgBox "world"` (041) ->
  cookie `0xA995`. The cookie changes with literal content even
  though the bytecode between ProcOpen and ProcEnd does NOT (see
  `test_pcode_call_dispatch_is_literal_independent`). The exact
  cookie algorithm is the remaining Phase 4 unknown.

### Phase 4d -- standard VBA module stream coexists (decoded)

In every Access database we inspected, the **same** LVAL row that
carries the OVBA-compressed source ALSO carries -- at an earlier
in-row offset -- the standard Office VBA module stream's
``PerformanceCache`` region, identified by the well-known
``0xCAFE`` magic word.

This region is the **canonical portable VBA7 p-code** as documented
in [MS-OVBA] section 2.3.4.3 and consumed by public disassemblers
such as [bontchev/pcodedmp](https://github.com/bontchev/pcodedmp).
Its layout (decompressed):

```
<binary metadata, declaration/indirect/object tables>
...
0xCAFE                           -- magic
<u16 numLines>
<numLines * 12-byte line records>
<per-line p-code bytes>          -- 264-opcode VBA7 instruction set
```

Each per-line p-code instruction is a u16 (low 10 bits = opcode,
upper 6 = opType flags), then 0-3 operand words depending on the
mnemonic. The full opcode table (264 mnemonics: ``Ld``, ``LitStr``,
``ArgsCall``, ``FuncDefn``, ``EndSub`` ...) is the VBA7 spec.

**This is NOT the same as the ``rU@``-prefixed bytecode** that
:meth:`AccessFile.read_module_pcode_stream` returns. The two forms
coexist in different LVAL rows:

* ``rU@`` row -- Access-specific cached/execodes form. Access uses
  this at runtime; modifying it breaks execution. Phase 4a-4c above
  reverse-engineered this form.
* CAFE-magic row -- standard portable VBA7 p-code. Runs on any
  Office host that supports VBA7. Production API:
  :meth:`AccessFile.find_module_streams` returns the raw bytes plus
  CAFE offset.

Locked by `test_module_stream_contains_cafe_magic` (all 10
single-Sub corpus samples 040-049) and
`test_module_stream_is_distinct_from_rU_pcode_stream`.

**Strategic implication**: the standard VBA module stream is a
well-documented format with a public disassembler. Production work
can build on top of `find_module_streams()` immediately (full VBA
disassembly, structural source replacement) without further
reverse-engineering the ``rU@`` form -- as long as we also keep
``rU@`` in sync (or force Access to recompile from source on next
open).

### Phase 4e -- dependency-free VBA7 disassembler (SHIPPED)

`pyopenvba.vba_pcode` ships a **pure-Python, dependency-free**
disassembler for the canonical CAFE-magic VBA7 p-code. It contains
the full 264-entry VBA7 opcode table (factual data; clean
re-implementation -- no GPL'd source code reused from `pcodedmp` or
any other project) plus a streaming line/instruction parser.

Encoding note: every Access database produced by the modern Office
toolchain uses **VBA7 64-bit encoding** -- raw opcode index ==
canonical table index, with no remap. This is the disassembler's
default (`is_64bit=True`). Pass `is_64bit=False` for VBA6 or 32-bit
VBA7 hosts; the +1/+2/+3 remap above raw opcode 173 will be applied.

The disassembler walks:

```
CAFE word -> 2 reserved -> u16 numLines ->
numLines * 12-byte line records
    (4 skip, u16 line_length, 2 skip, u32 line_offset) ->
10 reserved -> p-code region
```

Records with `line_offset == 0xFFFFFFFF` are source-only lines
(`Attribute VB_Name = ...`, `Option Compare Database`, blank lines)
with no compiled bytecode -- the disassembler emits an empty
`PCodeLine` for these so output indices line up with source order.

Production API:

* `AccessFile.disassemble_module(name, *, is_64bit=True) -> DisassembledModule`
  -- end-to-end disassembly of a named module.
* `pyopenvba.vba_pcode.disassemble_module_stream(raw_bytes, *, is_64bit=True)`
  -- low-level entry point if you already have the carrier-row bytes.
* `DisassembledModule(cafe_offset, num_lines, lines)`,
  `PCodeLine(line_no, start_offset, byte_length, instructions)`,
  `PCodeInstruction(offset, raw_word, opcode, op_type, mnemonic,
   operands, payload)`.

Verified mnemonic recovery on the RE corpus:

| Sample | Source                       | Decoded p-code                                                                      |
|--------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 030    | `Sub A() : End Sub`          | `FuncDefn func_0x0 ; EndSub`                                                        |
| 040    | `Sub A() : MsgBox "hello"`   | `FuncDefn func_0x0 ; LitStr "hello" ; ArgsCall (op_type=0x10, argc=1) ; EndSub`     |
| 044    | `Sub A() : Dim x As Integer` | `FuncDefn func_0x0 ; Dim ; VarDefn var_0x58 ; EndSub`                               |

Locked by `test_disassemble_empty_sub_yields_funcdefn_and_endsub`,
`test_disassemble_msgbox_recovers_litstr_and_argscall`,
`test_disassemble_dim_recovers_dim_and_vardefn`, and
`test_disassemble_module_raises_for_unknown_name`.

**Not yet resolved (v1 scope)**: identifier-table resolution. The
opaque `name_id` / `var_id` / `func_id` operands carry a u16 / u32
slot id into the project's identifier table, which in Access lives
in a separate LVAL row not yet located by content scan. Without it,
disassembly emits placeholders like `name_0x22c` instead of the
human name (`MsgBox`). Mnemonic-level disassembly is fully usable
without it.

Tooling: `scripts/access_re_disasm_smoke.py` -- corpus-wide
sanity-check of the disassembler output.

Tooling: `scripts/access_re_dump_68_1.py`,
`scripts/access_re_compare_pcode_headers.py`,
`scripts/access_re_list_pcode_rows.py`,
`scripts/access_re_pcode_diff.py` (pairwise side-by-side diff).

### Phase 5 -- structural write primitives

Implement and test, in dependency order:

1. `set_module_source(name, src)` for length-matched source (already
   works via `replace_text`; promote to a public API once Phase 4 lets
   us regenerate the matching p-code).
2. `set_module_source(name, src)` for length-mismatched source --
   requires Phase 2 (B-tree rebalance) + Phase 4 (p-code regeneration).
3. `add_module(name, kind, src)` -- catalog insert + new p-code emit.
4. `rename_module(old, new)` -- catalog patch only.
5. `remove_module(name)` -- catalog delete + LVAL free.

Each capability ships with COM-oracle regression tests in
`tests/test_access.py` and a freshly baked fixture.
