# Changelog

All notable changes to pyOpenVBA are documented here. This project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Nothing yet.

## [5.2.3] - 2026-09-08

Three defects found by hunting the same seam the last few reports came
from: the sheet writer reading its own output back, or Excel's, and
assuming everything else looks the same.

### Fixed

- **A sheet could not be picked by a name holding `&`, `<`, `>` or `"`.**
  Those are stored escaped, so a sheet named `A & B` sits in the file as
  `A &amp; B`. Attribute values were read as stored and compared against
  the name a caller passed, so the lookup failed and reported the escaped
  spelling back in the error. Values are decoded on the way in and
  escaped again on the way out.

- **An apostrophe in a sheet name was not doubled in the defined name.**
  A reference spells `It's` as `'It''s'`; a single apostrophe closes the
  quoting early, so the name pointed at something else. Names opening
  with a digit are quoted now as well, since unquoted they read as part
  of a cell reference. Excel accepts all of them and reports the
  references back exactly.

- **The sheet's declared extent was never widened on a foreign sheet.**
  The element was matched by its exact spelling, so a writer that puts a
  space before the closing slash, as openpyxl does, kept the extent it
  started with and the part said the sheet ended before the table began.

Nothing here changes what is written for a workbook Excel authored.

## [5.2.2] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **Loading onto any sheet but the first made the workbook unopenable.**
  The hidden `ExternalData_N` name was written with a constant
  `localSheetId="0"`, and that attribute is the zero-based position of
  the sheet the name belongs to. Loading to the second sheet wrote a name
  claiming the first while its reference named the second, and Excel
  refused the file outright. It is looked up now, from the same list of
  sheets that settles which part a sheet is.

  A one-sheet workbook cannot show this, which is why every fixture here
  missed it. The live gate loads onto each of three sheets and has Excel
  open and refresh all three.

## [5.2.1] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- **Loading a query onto a sheet failed on a workbook another tool
  wrote.** Three assumptions here came from reading only Excel's output,
  and each broke on openpyxl's, which is as legal. Relationships were
  matched with the id written first, where openpyxl writes it last, so a
  sheet looked as though it had no part behind it and the load was
  refused. `<definedNames />` written closed got a second block appended
  beside it rather than being filled, leaving two in the workbook. And a
  `tablePart` was added using the `r:` prefix on worksheets that never
  declared it, because a worksheet with no table has no use for one,
  which left the part not well formed. Excel now opens and refreshes a
  query loaded into a workbook openpyxl wrote.

  Saving through openpyxl still discards the Power Query package, since
  it rebuilds the file from the parts it models and drops the rest. That
  is not ours to fix, and `docs/power_query.md` now says so.

- **`[trash]` parts are dropped instead of carried forward.** Excel's
  file recovery leaves the parts it threw out under `[trash]/NNNN.dat`.
  An OPC part name cannot open a segment with a bracket, and Excel will
  not open a package holding one: the same workbook opens before the
  entry is added and raises after. The container preserves entries as
  they arrive, which handed back a file that stayed broken, so `save()`
  now takes them out and warns. Nothing depends on them: no content type
  declares them and no relationship points at them.

### Internal

- `openpyxl` joins the dev extras, so the interop tests run against the
  real writer rather than only against a copy of its output. The runtime
  still has no dependencies.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **`rename_form()` and `rename_report()`** ([#21]). A design's name lives
  in four places: its container's listing, its catalog row, its
  navigation-pane row, and the module behind it, which Access binds by
  name as `Form_<name>` or `Report_<name>`. A design Access has never
  opened a code window for has no module, and then there are three. The
  live gate renames a form that has code, opens the design in Access, and
  reads the code back through the VBE.

### Fixed

- **A stale `DocClass=` line made Access call the whole project corrupt**
  ([#21]). `PROJECT` names the module behind a form or report only as
  `DocClass=<name>/<flags>`, never as `Module=` or `Class=`. The renamer
  reached the first two and the workspace line and left `DocClass` alone,
  so a rename produced a project naming a module it no longer had. Access
  opened the database and showed the form, then reported the project as
  corrupt on the first VBE reference. The remover had the same gap, so a
  `DocClass=` line survived a delete. Both handle it now, carrying the
  flag word after the slash through untouched.

- **`delete_form()` and `delete_report()` left the module behind.** The
  design went and its code stayed, listed in the VBE for a form that no
  longer existed, and `delete_module` would not take it either because a
  design's module has no storage folder. Deleting a design now removes
  its module first, while the design is still there to name it.

- **The first module in a project with none went unlisted.** Module
  creation only updated the container's listing when the container
  already had one, where design and macro creation create it. It also
  needed an existing `Module=` or `Class=` line to insert after, so
  adding a module back after deleting a project's last one raised
  `ValueError` out of the PROJECT editor. Both containers now go through
  one helper, and the first line of an empty module block opens below
  `ID=`, where Access puts it. Found by the xlide_vscode port, which hit
  it first on a blank template with no modules at all.

## [5.1.3] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **`delete_module` took a module's storage folder by position** ([#19]).
  The position came from `modules()`, which is dir-stream order and
  includes the module behind a form or report. Those have no folder under
  `Modules`, so the two lists were different lengths and every module
  after a document one sat a place high. Deleting the last module of a
  project that has a coded form raised `IndexError`, and the same
  arithmetic quietly took another module's folder in the cases that did
  not run off the end. The folder now comes from the container's own
  `DirData`, which names it, the way `_delete_design` already read it.
  Asked to delete the code behind a form, `delete_module` now says so
  instead of taking the next module's folder.

- **Decimal keys and values rounded at 29 digits** ([#20]). Both codecs
  scaled through Python's default arithmetic context, which rounds at 28,
  while the column is a 16-byte magnitude. `2**96 - 1` came back five too
  high, so a key stopped naming the row it pointed at, and an index entry
  that does not match its row sorts wrong and never matches on lookup.
  The row and index codecs now share `scaled_decimal` and `scaled_int`,
  which run at a precision no value a column can hold will overflow. The
  index also rounds a fractional value the way the row encoder does,
  rather than truncating, so the two agree on the same input.

## [5.1.2] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- **The Access VBA writer read no PROJECTCODEPAGE** ([#18]). It encoded
  and decoded every ANSI string as latin-1: module source, the dir
  stream's name and stream-name records, the PROJECTwm entries, the
  PROJECT stream, and reference names and libids. Two consequences, and
  the first reaches ordinary English projects. Writing a module died
  outright on anything latin-1 cannot hold, so an em dash, a curly
  quote, an ellipsis or a euro sign in a comment raised
  `UnicodeEncodeError`; latin-1 and cp1252 differ over exactly the
  0x80-0x9F band those live in. And every non-1252 project was read
  through the wrong page, which is invisible on a round trip because
  latin-1 is a byte-identity codec and only shows once the text is
  displayed or re-encoded.

  The writer now resolves the project's declared code page the way the
  readers already did, through `encoding_for_codepage`, and encodes with
  `encode_mbcs`, so a character the page genuinely cannot hold folds to
  `?` in the ANSI record while the UTF-16 record beside it stays exact.
  That is what the VBE writes. A live gate has Access read an em dash, a
  curly quote, an ellipsis and a euro sign back out of a module written
  here.

### Added

- **The Access write path joins the language-matrix CI job.** The same
  per-code-page sweep the Excel writer has had since [#13] now runs
  against a database whose PROJECTCODEPAGE is each of the twenty-one
  pages, covering module source, native module names through add,
  rename and delete, and the cp1252 punctuation band on its own.

### Documentation

- **TypeInfo member names in `_designs.py` are cp1252, measured.** The
  issue raised the hardcode there as a possible second instance. It is
  not one: Access named a control with an em dash and wrote one byte,
  `0x97`, which cp1252 gives U+2014 and latin-1 cannot represent at all,
  and patching the project's PROJECTCODEPAGE to 1251 changed nothing.
  That stream does not follow the VBA code page and must not be threaded
  with it. Access also drops a member whose name the page cannot hold
  rather than substituting it, which the writer here does not; it
  differs only for names cp1252 cannot express.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-09-05

### Changed

- **`examples/power_query_refresh.py`** no longer demonstrates a state
  Excel's dialog cannot build. Its third query removed its data before
  saving without also refreshing on open, which Excel draws as a ticked
  box greyed out beneath an unticked one. That query now does both, and
  is called `Transient` rather than `Manual`, since its rows are fetched
  when the workbook opens and dropped again when it is saved.

### Added

- **What that pairing actually is**, in `docs/power_query.md`. The
  dialog's wiring is not a rule about the file. Excel's object model sets
  `QueryTable.SaveData = False` with refresh-on-open off and raises
  nothing; Excel writes the same shape itself when refresh-on-open is
  ticked, remove-data is ticked, and refresh-on-open is then unticked;
  and Excel resaves a workbook pyOpenVBA wrote that way with the
  attribute intact. So `keep_data = False` on its own stays legal, and
  the only cost is a query whose table opens empty until someone
  refreshes it.
- `test_excel_keeps_remove_data_without_refresh_on_open` in the live
  gate, which holds that measurement, and a test that the shipped example
  writes nothing the dialog cannot reach.
- Live coverage for `examples/power_query_refresh.py`. All three of its
  queries now have to refresh in Excel, and Excel's object model has to
  report the profiles the example's own printed table claims. The other
  two Power Query examples already had this.

### Fixed

- The 5.0.0 entry's link to `docs/power_query.md` was relative, which
  resolves from inside the repository but not from the GitHub release
  page the entry was published to. It is an absolute URL now, in the
  changelog and in the published release notes.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **Refresh control on a loaded query.** `query.refresh` gives the
  settings behind Excel's Connection Properties dialog: `background`,
  `interval_minutes`, `on_open`, `keep_data`, `in_refresh_all` and
  `enabled`. None of them live in the Power Query package; they sit on
  the workbook connection the query loads through, and two are mirrored
  onto the query table. Where each is written was measured by toggling it
  in Excel and diffing the file, and two are not where the wording
  suggests: removing data before saving reads from
  `queryTable/@removeDataOnSave`, and staying out of Refresh All is
  stored as an exclusion in a connection extension. The live gate sets all
  six from Python and has Excel's object model read them back.

  "Enable Fast Data Load" is deliberately absent. Excel's object model
  does not expose it, so there was no way to watch Excel write it.

- **`examples/power_query_refresh.py`** gives three loaded queries three
  refresh profiles, and prints what each one will do.

- **`examples/power_query_steps.py`**, a second Power Query example built
  around a query's Applied Steps. It writes a sales pipeline whose main
  query has eleven steps, and keeps those steps in a list with `#PREV`
  standing for the step before, so inserting or removing one is a list
  operation and the references rewire themselves. Both the built workbook
  and an edited copy refresh in Excel.
- `quote_name()` and `unquote_name()` are public, so code that generates M
  can spell a name the way M spells it without reaching into a private
  module.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **Power Query, read and written in pure Python.** A workbook keeps its
  Get and Transform queries in one custom XML part: an OPC package
  holding an M section document, a metadata document beside it and a
  permission list, all base64 inside a `DataMashup` element.
  `PowerQueryWorkbook` opens any Excel package -- `.xlsx` included, which
  has no VBA project at all -- and reads, edits, adds, renames, groups
  and removes the queries in it.

  - `queries()`, `query(name)`, `query_names()`, and per query the
    formula, description, steps, load target, group and every metadata
    entry Excel recorded.
  - `add_query()`, `remove_query()`, `rename_query()` (which rewrites the
    queries that name the old one, through the M tokenizer, so a match
    inside a text literal or a record's field name is left alone),
    `set_section_text()` for the whole document at once.
  - `add_group()` / `remove_group()` and `move_to_group()` for the
    folders in the Queries pane.
  - `load_to_sheet()` and `unload()`, which write and remove the
    connection, query table, table and sheet reference that actually put
    a query's result on a worksheet.
  - `PowerQueryWorkbook.create_new()` builds a workbook from nothing.
  - `pull_power_query()` / `push_power_query()` and `pq-ls`, `pq-pull`,
    `pq-push` on the command line: one `.m` file per query beside a
    manifest carrying the names a file name cannot hold.

  The writer aims at Excel's own bytes rather than at something Excel
  will accept. A workbook read and written unchanged is identical to the
  byte; a package rebuilt from its parts reproduces Excel's ZIP exactly,
  down to the raw deflate at level 6 and the growth-hint extra field; and
  the metadata section, the entry encodings and the query-group blob are
  byte-identical to what Microsoft's own packaging assemblies produce for
  the same input. Twelve live gates have Excel open what was written and
  evaluate it, and
  [docs/power_query.md](https://github.com/WilliamSmithEdward/pyOpenVBA/blob/main/docs/power_query.md)
  records how every rule was measured, including the three that a
  specification would not tell you: a query is a metadata item with at
  least one entry, the permission list and the metadata content package
  are both load-bearing, and the permission bindings are not.

- **`examples/power_query_demo.py`** builds a workbook of twelve queries
  in four groups, six of them loaded onto a sheet, reading JSON from four
  public APIs in five shapes: a list of records, one request per row, a
  list of bare numbers, GeoJSON features, a record whose field names are
  data, and a record of records. Every query in it was refreshed in Excel
  before it was committed.

### Changed

- The deflate port moved from `pyopenvba.access._deflate` to
  `pyopenvba._deflate`, where both the Access attachment codec and the
  Power Query package writer use it, and gained `raw_compress()` for the
  headerless stream a ZIP entry carries.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-09-05

### Added

- **Access has the same API as the other hosts.** `AccessDatabase` gains
  `module_names()`, `get_module()`, `set_module()`, `add_module()` (taking
  `VBAModuleKind`), `vba_project()` with `add_module` / `rename_module` /
  `delete_module`, and `pull_modules()` / `push_modules()`; the top level
  gains `push_access()` beside `pull_access()`, and the command line
  `access-push` beside `access-pull`. Forms and reports come back from
  `forms()`, `reports()`, `form()` and `add_form()` / `add_report()` as
  `AccessForm` objects with `walk()`, `control()`, `properties()`,
  `set_property()`, `add_control()`, `remove_control()` and `set_code()`,
  the calls a UserForm takes; a control is an `AccessControl` with the
  same `properties()` / `set_property()`. Removing a control re-marks the
  ones left in its section and closes the tab order up behind it; the
  live gate has Access read back what remains.

- **Compact and Repair.** `db.compact_and_repair()` builds a new database
  the way DAO's `CompactDatabase` does: a bare engine skeleton with every
  object copied in -- containers, forms and modules, then tables, queries
  and links in the order of the catalog's Name index, rows in primary-key
  order, indexes built over them, AutoNumber counters reset to the largest
  value present, permission rows and property blobs written in a last
  pass, relationships re-created. Jet 4 `.mdb` files take their own
  skeleton. Under a frozen engine clock five compactions -- tables with
  deletes, keys and memos; counters and queries; attachments; forms,
  reports, macros, modules, a link and seven query shapes; a Jet 4 file
  -- match the engine's output on every page but page 0. The
  result keeps the source's creation date, because the engine keys its
  encoding of owner and permission SIDs to that date (a 30-bit fold of
  five of its bytes feeds a generator that stayed unknown), so those
  bytes copy across unchanged. A table whose definition runs past one
  page is built column by column as the engine builds it, two writes
  per column onto fresh continuation pages, and the destination grows
  and lets rewritten pages back into use by the engine's rule (64 pages
  ahead, then 8 or 64 at a time, the waiting pages returning once 24
  pages have been taken since they last did), so the stale pages behind
  a wide table and every page after them land where the engine puts
  them: a sixth compaction, two 161-column tables with a memo, a key and
  rows, matches the engine page for page.

- **Fourteen more form property codes are named** -- `Glow`, `Shadow`,
  `QuickStyle`, `HoverForeColor`, `PressedForeColor` and the hover and
  pressed theme index, tint and shade properties -- by differencing a
  command button and a toggle button in Access, taking the table to 180.
  The four codes still keyed by number, 700-703, turned out not to be
  properties: they are the insets a button keeps for an effect that is
  off, dropped in favour of the paddings when Glow or Shadow is set.

- **`SELECT ... INTO` makes a table.** The make-table query creates the
  table the engine creates: a copied column keeps its definition, an
  expression gets the type the engine's own inference gives it (157
  expressions measured, every definition page byte-identical), the rows
  follow, and the three quirks a made table's headers carry -- computed
  columns variable-length, ordinals from one, a Decimal's precision and
  scale leaking into the columns after it -- are written as the engine
  writes them.
- **`UPDATE` and `DELETE` run over a join**, writing to either table of
  the join, applying every join row in the engine's order, and refusing
  what the engine refuses: a subquery in a SET clause, a join DELETE that
  does not name its table, a row a DELETE reaches twice.
- **A FROM clause with joins in parentheses reads** -- `(A INNER JOIN B
  ON ...) INNER JOIN C ON ...`, which is how Access writes every query
  over three tables, and the group on the right side too.
- **A numeric literal with an exponent** (`1E3`, `1.5E-1`) reads.

- **A table's rows can be packed onto fewer pages.**
  `db.rebuild_table(name)` reads a table's rows out, drops the table,
  makes it again from the same definition and writes the rows back, so
  they land on as few pages as they need; `db.compact(rebuild=True)` does
  that for every table it can and then reclaims the file's tail. A
  2000-row table cut to 200 went from 270 pages to 92.

  Deleting rows does not shrink a table -- not here and not in Access,
  which is what Compact and Repair is for -- so until now a large delete
  left the space stranded: free pages, but in the middle, where the
  trailing-run reclaim could not reach them.

  Both halves are writers the engine was measured against, so this adds
  no new way to lay a table out. It refuses a table it cannot carry
  across whole -- one with a complex column, a link, or a relationship
  naming it -- and it compares the rows before and after, putting the
  whole database back if they differ. A rebuild either round-trips or
  changes nothing. The AutoNumber values and their counter are kept,
  where Access's own compact resets the counter.

  `db.table_specs(name)` is the piece that made it possible: the table
  described as the `ColumnSpec` and `IndexSpec` list that would create it
  again, with sizes in the units those take rather than the header's
  bytes.

- **Charts and Edge browsers can be written**, and the reader knows two
  more types (navigation buttons and the navigation control's own kind).
  That takes the reader to 28 control types and the writer to 23. Naming
  a record is not needed to write one: a slot whose code has no
  established meaning is keyed by its code, which also expresses the one
  case a name could not -- an Edge browser carries code 450 twice, at two
  ids.

  Three records Access writes on these are deliberately left out. 596,
  597 and 600 put the control in a layout, which is where the designer
  drops a new one; with them written, Access stacks a chart under
  whatever else claims the same layout instead of leaving it where it was
  put. Isolating that took building the same three-control form five ways
  and comparing where Access reported each control.

  A navigation control stays read-only for a reason that is not about
  codes: it is not one control. One of its records names a sibling
  subform by name, and Access builds navigation buttons beside it, so one
  written alone would point at a subform that is not there.

- **A design's properties can be changed.**
  `db.set_control_property(form, control, "FontSize", 18)` and
  `db.set_design_property(form, "Caption", "My window")` write one
  property of one control, section, or of the form or report itself.
  Access reads every one back exactly as written -- captions, fonts,
  colours, sizes, control sources, tips and tags among them.

  `PROPERTY_CODES` grew from 40 names to 107 along the way. Codes whose
  values are small integers every other property also uses cannot be
  named by matching values, so those were named by differencing: build
  the same form twice, identical but for one property, and see which
  record moved.

  A record's id is its slot in that object type's own schema, so changing
  a property an object does not already carry means knowing the id Access
  would have given it. `PROPERTY_SLOTS` holds 959 of those across 26
  object types, every one read off an object Access itself wrote; across
  seven databases every id, code and value type agreed, and so did every
  length except the strings', whose length is their text's. A property
  the object already carries keeps its record where it stands; a name
  that is not in the table is refused rather than written somewhere it
  does not belong.

- **Every control type pyOpenVBA can read, it can now write.**
  `add_control` wrote a Label or a TextBox; it now writes all eighteen --
  CommandButton, ToggleButton, OptionButton, CheckBox, OptionGroup,
  ListBox, ComboBox, Rectangle, Line, Image, PageBreak,
  BoundObjectFrame, ObjectFrame, Subform, Tab and Page as well. Every
  slot's id, code, value type and width was read back from a control
  Access itself made, and each type gets only the slots it has: a page
  break carries a top and nothing else, a tab control no left or top at
  all, an image no overlap flags, a combo box its GUID ahead of its
  name. A button is written with the padding Access gives it, a list or
  combo box with `Table/Query` as its row source type, and anything that
  takes the focus with the next tab index.

- **Twenty-nine more design property codes named**, taking the table from
  40 to 69. Access's `SaveAsText` writes a design's properties with their
  names, so pairing that against the blob names the codes -- but pair on
  the *value*, not the position: the blob carries records the text does
  not write, so a straight walk drifts and starts naming codes wrongly a
  few records in. Both runs re-derived every code already named and
  contradicted none, which is what makes the new names evidence rather
  than a guess. `docs/research/access_designs/` carries the scripts.

- **Six control types the reader did not recognise at all**: custom
  (ActiveX) controls, attachment controls, the web browser, the
  navigation control, charts and the Edge browser. All six now parse and
  report their type; the first three are written as well, and Access
  accepts each. The other three are read but not written: each
  carries records this project cannot name -- 450, 456, 458, 600 among
  them, and a dozen more on a chart -- and on the navigation control and
  the Edge browser one of those, 450, appears twice at two ids, which a
  table keyed by property name cannot express. Writing one is refused
  with the reason rather than attempted.

  That takes the reader to 27 control types and the writer to 21. Two
  more codes Access accepts, 131 and 132, turn out to be alternate ways
  to ask for a subform and a text box: the file records them as 112 and
  109.

- **A control can hold controls.** `add_control(..., parent="Tabs")` puts
  a page on a tab control, which is written as a group of its own right
  after it. Reading a design is now a tree walk rather than a flat scan,
  since a section's count is of its own controls and not of everything
  beneath them. A page must have a parent tab and nothing else may have
  one, both of which are refused rather than written.

  The live gate puts one of every writable type on a single form and has
  Access name them all back, and builds a tab control with two pages
  between a text box and a button -- Access reports the tab as each
  page's parent and the form as the parent of the two beside it.

- **Jet 3 (Access 97) databases read.** `AccessDatabase` opens a 2 KiB
  page `.mdb` and reads its catalog, tables, rows and long values the
  same way it reads an `.accdb`. Everything that moved between the two
  versions lives in one `Layout` record, so there is a single parser, a
  single row splitter and a single set of value decoders rather than a
  second implementation: the page halves, a row counts its columns and
  its variable-column offsets in bytes rather than words, text is stored
  in the code page page 0 names rather than UTF-16, and the definition,
  column, index and name headers all shrink and move.

  Every offset was measured against files the Jet engine wrote, and the
  parser checks that what it consumed equals the length the page
  declares. The live gate has DAO 3.6 -- which still creates Access 97
  files though Access dropped the format in 2013 -- build a database with
  every Jet 3 column type, a 4000-character memo, code page text, a
  deleted row and four hundred rows over many pages; pyOpenVBA reads the
  same file with no COM involved and the two agree cell for cell.

  Writing a Jet 3 file is refused rather than attempted, at the page
  store itself, so nothing can put a Jet 4 shape into one.

- **Compaction.** `db.compact()` gives back the free pages at the end of
  the file and says how many went. That is what a dropped table or a
  large delete leaves behind, and it is the part of compaction that can
  be done without moving a page: nothing moves and no object is
  rewritten, so nothing can be lost. Free pages in the middle keep their
  place, and the first two pages are never dropped.

  A 954 KB database with a dropped 3000-row table came back at 300 KB
  with its other table intact. The live gate has the engine itself read
  a compacted file row for row and then run its own Compact and Repair
  over it, which rebuilds every page it kept.

  This is not Access's Compact and Repair, which also renumbers pages,
  resets AutoNumber counters and drops deleted rows from the middle of a
  table.

- **The domain functions.** `DLookup`, `DCount`, `DSum`, `DAvg`, `DMin`,
  `DMax`, `DFirst`, `DLast`, `DStDev`, `DStDevP`, `DVar` and `DVarP` run
  in `db.execute(...)`. Each is a query over another table, so each runs
  as one: `DLookup("Total", "Orders", "Id = 1")` is
  `SELECT Total FROM Orders WHERE Id = 1`. A criteria can name a column
  of the row it is evaluated in, which is what makes them worth having.

  These are Access's own rather than the database engine's, so DAO cannot
  answer for them: the gate compares every one against Access's `Eval` on
  the same database, and all seventeen agree.

- **The password guard reaches Access.** `db.vba_is_protected()` reads
  the `PROJECT` stream's `DPB` record, and `db.save()` refuses to write a
  VBA change into a protected project unless it is told
  `allow_protected=True` -- which is what the other hosts already do on
  their own `save`. A change that is not to the VBA project saves as
  before.

- **The project's references.** `db.references()` reads the libraries a
  VBA project points at, `db.add_reference(name, guid, major, minor,
  path=, description=)` adds one and `db.drop_reference(name)` removes
  it. A live gate adds the Scripting Runtime, writes a module that uses
  `Scripting.Dictionary`, and has Access compile and run it.

  Access keeps them only in the dir stream, three records each --
  `REFERENCEORIGINAL`, its Unicode twin, and `REFERENCEREGISTERED`
  holding `*\G{GUID}#major.minor#lcid#path#description`. `PROJECT`
  carries no `Reference=` line, and the two libraries every project has,
  VBA itself and Access, are not in the file at all. The version is
  written in **hex**: DAO 12.0 is stored as `c.0`.

- **Forms and reports.** `db.forms()`, `db.reports()`, `db.form(name)`,
  `db.report(name)`, `db.create_form(name)`, `db.create_report(name)`,
  `db.delete_form(name)` and `db.delete_report(name)`. A live gate opens
  what this writes in Access's own designer, and a created form also
  opens in form view.

  A design is a stream of property records, `<u32 id><u16 code><u32
  type><u32 width><u32 length><value>`, with the ids ascending inside one
  object. Three ids are not properties but markers that open the next
  object: `0xFE` a section, `0xFD` the next object at the same level, and
  `0xFF` a control, which carries a second `u16` naming its type. Every
  design measured -- an empty form, a form with a label and a text box,
  and a report with its three sections -- rebuilds byte for byte.

  `db.add_control(design, type, name, ...)` puts a Label or a TextBox on
  one, and Access reads back every measurement it was given. Thirty-three
  property codes are named, worked out by exporting a design with
  `SaveAsText` -- which writes the same records with their names, in the
  same order -- and walking the two together.

  A control belongs to a section and is written immediately after it, and
  its marker depends on **how many controls that section holds**: one is
  a single child, `0xFE`; two or more open a group, `0xFF` then `0xFD`.
  Access writes both in one report -- a page header holding one control
  and a detail band holding two -- and refuses each in the other's place,
  with "saved in an invalid format" for one of them.

  `db.set_design_code(name, code)` puts code behind one, creating the
  module when the design has none, and Access runs it. A document module
  belongs to its design rather than to `Modules`: no storage folder, no
  catalog row, and a `DocClass=` line in `PROJECT` where a class module
  gets `Class=`. Without that line Access loads the module and the form
  still does not answer to it. The design's `TypeInfo` and the module's
  `VB_Base` share a CLSID, and a byte in the design folder's `PropData`
  records that it has a module at all.

  Creating cuts from a captured empty design with a GUID of its own
  patched in, since the catalog row repeats the one the design carries.

- **Macros.** `db.macros()`, `db.macro(name)`, `db.create_macro(name,
  actions)` and `db.delete_macro(name)`, with `MacroAction(name,
  arguments)` for each step. A live gate creates a macro, has Access run
  it with `DoCmd.RunMacro`, and reads back the value it set.

  Access stores a macro as a binary blob, not as the XML its designer
  shows: a 32-byte header, a length-prefixed `"33"`, then one record per
  action carrying the action id, the row number, fourteen `u16` slots
  holding byte offsets into a string area, and the strings themselves.
  Arguments occupy slots from 4 upward and an empty one takes no slot,
  so a gap in the middle reads back as an empty string. Every blob in
  the fixture rebuilds byte for byte.

  Twenty-four action ids, measured by loading one macro each through
  `LoadFromText` and pairing storage folders with `MSysObjects` rows in
  id order. A macro's object id steps by **one** where a module's steps
  by four, and a macro gets no navigation-pane group row where a module
  does -- so the step is what an object reserves for itself rather than
  a global stride.

- **Attachments and multi-valued columns.** `db.complex_columns()` finds
  them, `table.attachments(column, key)` and
  `table.multi_values(column, key)` read them, `set_attachments` /
  `set_multi_values` write them, and
  `table.add_complex_column(name, kind)` creates one. An inserted row is
  given its complex id automatically. A live gate builds a database, a
  table and both kinds of column from nothing and has the ACE engine read
  the bytes back.

  Creating one costs four things beyond the column itself, and three were
  invisible until the engine refused the result. The flat table keeps its
  two Long bookkeeping columns **among the variable columns**, where a
  Long would normally sit in the fixed block, with no collation and no
  fixed bit -- `ColumnSpec(..., variable=True)` now says so. Its catalog
  row carries `Flags` `0x800A0000`. And the table that *has* the column
  carries `0x40000`, which no other table does; without it DAO opens the
  child recordset and finds no fields in it.

  A `Complex` column keeps only a Long in the row -- an id shared by
  every complex column in that row, handed out from a counter at 0x1C of
  the table definition and never reused. The values live one per row in
  `f_<GUID>_<Column>`, joined on that Long, and `MSysComplexColumns`
  names the pairing. `FileData` is a container of its own: a flag and an
  inflated size, then either a zlib stream or the bytes as they are, and
  inside that a header carrying the file's extension.

  Access decides whether to compress **by file type**, measured across 45
  extensions: it leaves `docx`, `gif`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `png`, `pptx`,
  `xlsx` and `zip` alone and compresses everything else, including `7z`
  and `mp4`. Those eight are written byte-identically; a compressed one
  was not at the time -- see the fix above: the deflate is classic zlib's
  at level 5 and memLevel 7, which the zlib-ng behind Python's `zlib`
  cannot reproduce.

  Two corrections to the table definition came out of this: the field at
  0x18 is a constant (1 in ACE, -1 in Jet 4) and not a counter, and the
  complex-id counter is the u32 at 0x1C. A complex column is flagged
  AutoNumber like any other, so the row writer had been handing it a
  value from the ordinary AutoNumber counter, which gave two columns in
  one row two different ids.

- **Access VBA is writable.** `AccessDatabase` gained `modules()`,
  `module(name)`, `create_module(name, code, kind="module"|"class")`,
  `set_module_source(name, code)`, `rename_module(old, new)` and
  `delete_module(name)`. Standard and class modules both, with whatever
  source you give them.

  The route is not a p-code writer. `_VBA_PROJECT` is [MS-OVBA]'s
  PerformanceCache, and its `Version` field names the build of VBA that
  compiled it; writing a version the host does not recognise makes VBA
  discard the cache and compile the project from the module streams, the
  same thing Access's `/decompile` does. A module's stream is therefore
  the compressed source alone with MODULEOFFSET at zero, and none of the
  compiled tables have to be generated -- one of which could not have
  been, since the 32-slot table ahead of the module table is runtime
  state and adding the same module to the same database twice gives two
  different tables. The cost is a recompile on the next open: the code
  has to compile, and the cache stops matching what Access wrote until
  Access rewrites it.

  Three of the rules are invisible from the file and were caught only by
  asking Access: a module's storage folder is named from the rows its
  container already holds and Access will not look under any other name,
  `MSysObjects` ids step by four rather than one, and a delete has to
  free the folder or the next create picks a name Access rejects. A live
  gate (`RUN_LIVE_ACCESS_VBA=1`) runs the result in Access and compares
  the value the code returns, class instantiation included.

- **More of the statement.** `TOP n PERCENT`, `ORDER BY <position>`, and
  a comparison against `ALL`, `ANY` or `SOME` of a subquery. A column
  name two sources share is now qualified in the output the way the
  engine qualifies it, and a crosstab pivoting on a comparison names its
  columns -1 and 0.

- **The rest of the Jet expression functions.** Replace, Space, String,
  StrComp, StrReverse, Asc, Chr, Sgn, Sqr, Exp, Log, Fix, Val, Str, Hex,
  Oct, the CBool/CByte/CCur/CSng/CDate family, DateAdd, DateDiff,
  DatePart, DateSerial, TimeSerial, Weekday, WeekdayName, MonthName,
  DateValue, TimeValue, Time, IsNull, IsNumeric, IsDate, Switch, Choose,
  Format and Partition, with the First, Last, StDev, StDevP, Var and
  VarP aggregates. A gate runs 131 expressions through DAO and through
  the executor over the same four rows and compares them cell by cell.

- **Truth values as Jet writes them.** A computed comparison, logical
  operator or yes-or-no function now answers -1 or 0, and so does an
  aggregate over a Boolean column, which is what the engine answers. A
  Boolean column selected on its own still reads as a Boolean.

- **Linked tables.** `db.links()` and `db.link(name)` read the tables a
  database only points at; `db.link_table(name, database, source,
  connect=...)` writes one and `db.drop_link(name)` forgets it, byte for
  byte as DAO's `TableDefs.Append` and `Delete` do, for a link to another
  Access file and to a folder of text files. Following a link is left to
  the caller: the path comes out of the database, so opening it is not
  something the library does on its own.

- **A column's own rules.** Required, DefaultValue, ValidationRule and
  ValidationText are properties on the column, not bits in its header,
  and the writers now put them there the way the engine does: one blob
  write per column, the engine's DAO type and flags, and the catalog
  stamp that goes with it. `CREATE TABLE ... NOT NULL` and
  `DEFAULT <expr>` set them, and `ColumnSpec` carries them.

- **The engine's rules applied to every row.** A column an INSERT does
  not name takes its DefaultValue, evaluated as Jet evaluates it; a null
  in a Required column and a value against a ValidationRule, the
  column's or the table's, are refused with the engine's own message, on
  insert and on update. A live gate has the engine reject the same four
  statements.

- **Which LVAL page a long value lands on**, measured: a value of 256
  bytes or fewer goes on the first page the free-space map lists, a
  larger one on the last, and when that page cannot take it, on a new
  page rather than an earlier one.

- **A gate for a database built without the engine at all**: every
  column type, keyed and unique indexes, a foreign key, long values,
  four saved queries and table and column properties, all written by
  pyOpenVBA, then read back field for field by DAO and compacted by it,
  which fails on any structure the engine cannot follow.

- **Subqueries in saved queries.** A subquery in a WHERE, one used as a
  value, and a bracketed SELECT standing where a table does all save as
  the engine saves them; a derived table's text goes in its row's
  expression with only the alias naming it.

- **Pass-through queries.** `db.create_query(name, sql, connect=...)`
  saves one, byte for byte as DAO does, dead row and all; the SQL is
  kept exactly as given because the server parses it, not Jet.
  `query.connect` reads the connect string back.

- **Usage maps past their row.** A map whose bitmap can no longer grow
  inside its page becomes the engine's reference form: a row of chunk
  pointers, each naming a page holding one 32 736-page bitmap. The
  global free map converts the same way and marks each new chunk's
  unreached pages free. A 130 MB database of long values is now
  byte-identical to the engine's, both maps converted.

- **`with db.transaction():`** groups writes so they all land or none
  do; an exception puts the pages and the session's state back exactly
  as they were. The engine writes the same bytes either way, and a live
  gate checks that against DAO running the same statements inside
  BeginTrans/CommitTrans.

- **Crosstabs run, not just save.** `db.execute("TRANSFORM ... PIVOT
  ...")` returns the pivoted rows: one column per pivot value, `<>` for
  a Null heading, an `IN` list fixing the columns and their order, an
  aggregate allowed among the row headings, and the rows sorted by those
  headings as the engine sorts them. Two of these answer exactly as DAO
  does (live gate).
- **Jet's `Mod`, `\` and `^` operators**, in VBA's order of
  precedence, with both sides rounded half to even and the division
  truncating toward zero.

- **Subqueries, unions and saved queries in `db.execute`.** `IN`,
  `NOT IN`, `EXISTS`, `NOT EXISTS` and a scalar subquery work in any
  expression, correlated when they name the outer query; a bracketed
  SELECT or a saved query's name can stand where a table does in FROM;
  and `UNION` / `UNION ALL` fold left to right with a trailing ORDER BY
  over the result. Eight of these shapes answer exactly as DAO does on
  the same database (live gate).

- **DDL through `db.execute`.** CREATE TABLE (every Jet type word, named
  primary keys, inline and table constraints, foreign keys), CREATE
  [UNIQUE] INDEX with ASC/DESC columns and WITH IGNORE NULL, DROP TABLE,
  DROP INDEX, and ALTER TABLE ADD / ALTER / DROP COLUMN and ADD / DROP
  CONSTRAINT. Fourteen statements leave the same bytes DAO's Execute
  leaves for the same SQL (live gate). What the Jet parser refuses --
  `CHAR`, `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC`, `WITH COMPRESSION` -- is refused here
  with the reason.
- **A table with a BigInt column carries the engine's version
  properties** (`FCMinReadVer`, `FCMinWriteVer`, `FCMinDesignVer`),
  written one at a time as the engine writes them.

- **Crosstab saved queries.** `db.create_query(name, "TRANSFORM ... PIVOT
  ...")` writes the rows DAO writes, byte for byte, with an `IN` list, a
  TOP, a join or a parameter; `db.query(name).sql` gives the statement
  back. HAVING is refused there, as the engine refuses it.

- **`db.drop_index(table, name)`**, byte-identical to the engine's DROP
  INDEX: the index's pages released with their bytes untouched, its
  usage-map row deleted, its records taken out of the definition with
  the indexes after it moved up, and the catalog row stamped. The
  primary key and an index a relationship rests on are refused, as the
  engine refuses them.

- **SQL executor.** `AccessDatabase.execute(sql, parameters)` runs Jet
  SQL against the engine in pure Python: SELECT with a column list or
  `*`, INNER / LEFT / RIGHT JOINs, WHERE, GROUP BY with Count, Sum, Avg,
  Min and Max, HAVING, ORDER BY, DISTINCT and TOP; the comparison,
  logical, arithmetic and `&` operators, LIKE with the engine's
  wildcards, IN, BETWEEN, IS NULL, `[parameters]` and the common string,
  numeric and date functions; INSERT ... VALUES, INSERT ... SELECT,
  UPDATE and DELETE through the row writers, with values coerced to the
  column type as the engine coerces them. Three-valued logic follows the
  engine. Eleven SELECT shapes answer exactly as DAO does on the same
  database, name for name and value for value, and an UPDATE plus a
  DELETE write the same bytes DAO's Execute writes (live gate).
- **Index row counters.** An index built over existing rows records how
  many rows it holds next to its distinct-key count. Every row that
  leaves the index takes one off, whether deleted or written by an
  UPDATE that names one of the index's columns, and the distinct count
  is capped at what is left; a null key in an ignore-nulls index costs
  nothing, the count stops at zero, and an unfiltered DELETE zeroes
  both. Inserts leave the row counter alone, as the engine does.

### Fixed

- **Code behind a written form sees its controls, and their events fire.**
  Access lists a design's sections and controls in a `TypeInfo` stream
  beside it, and VBA takes that list as the form class's members. A form
  written here carried the empty template's list, so `Me.<control>` failed
  to compile and a button's click never bound. The stream is now carried
  forward on every change the way Access carries it: a new member is
  appended with the next ordinal, a removed one drops out and the rest
  keep their ordinals, a renamed one moves to the end with its ordinal.
  Each member's type id was read off a form and a report Access built
  with one of every control and every section
  (`tests/live_access_test/designs_every.accdb`): a report's controls
  share one class index, a label attached to a control or a button inside
  an option group has a class of its own, an ActiveX control's entry
  carries 36 more bytes, and a form's header, footer, page and group
  sections are read as sections. Three copies of that form edited in
  Access sit in the fixture, and the same edits made here give the same
  streams.
- **`RowSourceType` takes effect.** The text is only what the property
  sheet shows; Access acts on a one-byte companion record, written now
  with the text (a value list, a field list, or none for a table or query).
- **A written control brings its type's control-defaults object.** Access
  keeps one nameless object per control type ahead of a design's
  sections, the type's theme-derived defaults, and reads a control's
  themed properties against it: a button written without it ignored its
  `UseTheme`, colours and gradient and came out as a default themed
  button. The first control of a type now writes the object Access
  writes (captured per type for forms and for reports), the run of
  top-level objects is marked as the group it is, and a button's six
  hover and pressed slots are in its schema.
- **A colour or font set on a control takes effect.** With the defaults
  object in place, Access reads the theme index ahead of the colour, so
  `set_property("ForeColor", ...)` now writes the -1 index Access writes
  beside it (and `Gradient` 0 with a button's fill, `ThemeFontIndex` -1
  and the pitch-and-family byte with a font name), measured one property
  at a time on nine control types.
- **`set_database_properties()`** sets the database's own options --
  `StartUpForm` to open a form with the file, `AppTitle` and the rest --
  writing the MSysDb property blob byte for byte as DAO's
  `Properties.Append` does.

- **A second text box gets its tab index.** The text box Access made for
  the slot table was the first on its form and so carried no `TabIndex`;
  every later focusable control does, and the writer now gives one to a
  text box as it already did to every other type (measured: three text
  boxes written without it came back from Access tabbed 1, 2, 0).

- **A large long value lands on the highest-numbered listed page.** The
  engine takes the highest page the column's free-space map lists when
  it has room, and otherwise a fresh page; it does not go back to the
  page the last value went to. The two coincide until a delete lists an
  older page again, which is what Access's own module save does, and the
  library kept a per-column cursor for the wrong rule. Measured with DAO
  and held by the long-value placement gate; the page store's
  `lval_cursor` is gone.

- A long value of 256 bytes or fewer now takes the first listed page of
  its column rather than the page the last value went to, which is where
  the engine puts it (measured on a compaction's 200 memos).
- A relationship on a column that already has an index shares that index,
  as the engine's does; a table may now be related to itself; the
  relationship rows go before the index root.
- Rewriting a definition no longer resets its complex-id counter.
- A new object's owner is taken from MSysDb rather than the commonest
  owner among the tables, which in a fresh `.mdb` was the engine's own.
- Access's own MSysNameMap and MSysAccessXML, whose OLE column has no
  free-space map, can be written to and copied.
- **Compressed attachments are byte for byte what Access writes.** The
  engine's deflate turned out to be classic zlib's at level 5, memLevel 7
  and a 32 KB window -- one of eight engine-written streams admits exactly
  that parameter set, and classic zlib reproduces all eight -- where the
  earlier note that it "was not zlib's" came from comparing against the
  zlib-ng that Python bundles. Since a Python's zlib may not be classic
  zlib and exposes no memLevel, `pyopenvba.access._deflate` carries zlib's
  own algorithm; a live gate attaches five files through DAO and finds
  each stored container identical to ours.

- **A number keeps the engine's type through every operator.** `db.execute`
  now answers an `int`, a `float` or a `Decimal` exactly where the engine
  answers a Long, a Double or a Currency/Decimal: `5.5` and its arithmetic
  are Decimals, `5.5 / 3` runs to 28 places, `Sum(Long)` and `Abs` are
  Doubles, `Currency * Double` is a Double while `Currency + Double`
  stays Currency, `Date + 1` is a Date (it was a float), a Large Number
  takes everything into itself, and `IIf` widens its branches. Measured
  through DAO's reported type of 135 expressions and the full
  operator-by-type matrix; a live gate holds 185 of them and
  `docs/access_engine.md` has the rules, including the two that look at
  the shape of an operand rather than its value.

- **What a query stores in a column now matches the engine**, measured
  statement by statement against DAO: over-long Text is cut to size
  rather than refused (a Memo is not), a Byte takes the low byte of its
  number, a number in a Date column is its serial, a value list with no
  column list covers the AutoNumber too, an explicit AutoNumber moves the
  counter and a Null there is an error, and no query updates an
  AutoNumber.
- **An action query is all or nothing.** An INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE that
  fails part way leaves the rows as they were, through a page journal in
  the store rather than a copy of the file. The AutoNumber counter and the
  header's row count keep what the attempted rows took, which is what the
  engine leaves too.
- **Joins, GROUP BY and DISTINCT answer in the engine's order.** An inner
  join scans the smaller side and probes the other newest-first, groups
  and distinct rows come out sorted by their keys; an UPDATE over a join
  keeps the last join row's write, and which row that is now follows.
- **One- and two-character Text values are stored uncompressed**, as the
  engine stores them; compression is applied only where it shortens the
  value. Rows holding such values were one byte off the engine's.

### Removed

- **Jet 3 (Access 97) databases are refused again.** Reading them worked
  and was gated against the engine, but the scope is now what the Access
  application opens today, and Access has not opened an Access 97 file
  since 2013. A 2 KiB page format is a second set of offsets through the
  reader for a format nobody authors; `git log` has the implementation if
  it is ever wanted back.

  The plumbing that carried it went with it: the `Layout` record, the
  page size and text encoding read from the file rather than fixed, and
  the layout argument threaded through the page, row and definition
  readers. One page format means one set of constants, in the modules
  that own them, so there is no second source for an offset and no
  parameter that can only take one value.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- The README now introduces the form designer where a reader starts.
  3.5.0 documented it in full, but the "Why use this?" pitch and the
  "good fit for" list still described module operations only, and the
  architecture map predated `forms.py`, `_oforms_records.py`,
  `_oforms_pages.py` and `_ppt_container.py`, the `forms` CLI command,
  and the `.xlam` and `.accdb` templates.  PyPI renders a project page
  from the README in the released sdist, so correcting it there takes a
  release.

The library itself is unchanged: 3.5.0 and 3.5.1 are the same code.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- **UserForm designs are now read and written, not just preserved**
  (issue #15).  A form's *code* was always a module like any other; its
  *design* -- which controls exist, how they nest, and what their
  properties are -- lived in streams the library carried verbatim.  It is
  now a first-class surface, with no Office installed:

  ```python
  with pyopenvba.ExcelFile("book.xlsm") as wb:
      form = wb.add_form("Wizard", caption="Setup", width=300, height=200)
      form.add_control("Frame", "Shipping", left=12, top=40, width=200, height=80)
      form.add_control("OptionButton", "Ground", container="Shipping")
      form.add_control("MultiPage", "Tabs", left=12, top=140, width=280)
      form.add_page("Tabs", name="Review")
      form.control("Ground").set_property("Caption", "Ground shipping")
      wb.save()
  ```

  `host.forms()` reads the tree; `host.add_form()` composes one from
  nothing; `form.add_control()` / `remove_control()` / `add_page()` /
  `remove_page()` and `control.set_property()` edit it.  Containers
  recurse -- a `Frame`'s children and a `MultiPage`'s pages live in
  storages of their own -- and each is created and deleted with its
  storage.  Geometry is in points.  `python -m pyopenvba forms <file>`
  prints the tree; `--mask` gives the raw property bits instead.

- **Only what the developer set.**  MSForms stores a property just when it
  differs from that control's default, so `control.properties()` is the
  set the author chose -- which a live COM read cannot distinguish from
  inherited and default values.  That is the reason this belongs in a
  file-level library.

- **Writing is lossless.**  An unedited form saves back byte for byte:
  alignment padding, raw string bytes, pictures and any tail the property
  tables do not model are all replayed as read.  Bytes inside a record
  that the tables cannot explain are refused rather than dropped, and a
  form whose streams do not reconcile raises `FormParseError` rather than
  returning a partly guessed control list.

- **Verified against live Excel and live PowerPoint**, which is where four
  defects surfaced that no structural check could catch: an added control
  colliding with the last one's id (`NextAvailableID` is the highest
  handed out, not the next free), a MorphData record omitting reserved
  mask bit 31 ([MS-OFORMS] 2.2.5.2), a container written with a leaf's
  site, and a designer edit leaving the `_VBA_PROJECT` cache stale.

- **Path-addressed CFB navigation and editing**: `CFB.list_storages_at`,
  `list_streams_at`, `get_stream_at`, `write_stream_at`, `add_stream_at`,
  `add_substorage_at` (which can set a storage's CLSID), and
  `remove_storage_at` (recursive).  Nested designer storages repeat
  names -- every container owns an `f` -- so a name-based lookup finds
  whichever comes first in directory order.

- `VBAForm`, `FormControl`, `Size` and `FormParseError` are exported from
  the package root.

### Fixed

- **A UserForm edit left the VBA performance cache stale.**  Only module
  changes counted as mutating, so a designer-only save kept a
  `_VBA_PROJECT` cache describing the form's old members and Office
  refused to load the form.  A designer edit now invalidates it too.
- **`.ppt` was advertised but could not be read** (issue #17).
  `PowerPointFile` listed `.ppt` and failed on every real one with
  "No 'dir' stream found", which reads like file corruption and is not.
  Unlike `.doc` and `.xls`, a binary presentation's CFB root carries no
  VBA storage: the project is a whole CFB, zlib-deflated, inside an
  `ExOleObjStg` record of the `PowerPoint Document` stream, reached
  through the persist chain.  Both directions now work; the write path
  splices the record back in and shifts every absolute offset past it.
  Verified against live PowerPoint, each check run first against an
  untouched control: a rewritten presentation opens with its slides,
  titles and body text intact, and an edited macro returns the new value.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- **Non-Latin module names were corrupted in the PROJECT stream**
  (issue #11).  The PROJECT stream is code-page ANSI per [MS-OVBA]
  2.3.1, but four sites hardcoded cp1252, so any rewrite of it -- add,
  rename, or delete -- re-encoded module names with `errors="replace"`.
  A cp1251 project containing `МодульТест` came out as
  `Module=??????????` while the dir stream kept the real name; Excel
  cross-checks those declarations, so the project was left internally
  inconsistent.  `serialize_project_stream`, `parse_project_stream`, and
  `parse_projectwm` now take the project's `code_page` (defaulting to
  1252 for standalone callers) and the save path passes it.  Verified in
  live Excel: a cp1251 workbook whose module is *named* `МодульТест`
  now compiles and returns `Привет, мир` from a Cyrillic-named function.
- **Vietnamese text was destroyed on encode** (issue #13).  Python's
  charmap codecs do no composition, so `'Tiếng Việt'.encode('cp1258')`
  lost every stacked-diacritic character -- and NFD does not help, since
  cp1258 stores `ệ` as precomposed `ê` plus a combining dot-below rather
  than its canonical decomposition.  The new
  `pyopenvba.vba.encode_mbcs` decomposes unmappable characters and folds
  each combining mark back into the base until the codec accepts the
  result, emitting the remaining marks as combining bytes.  Text the
  codec already encodes directly is returned byte-for-byte unchanged.
- **Code pages resolved differently on Windows than on Linux/macOS.**
  CPython falls through to the operating system's code-page registry on
  Windows, so `cp10000`, `cp20866`, `cp21866`, `cp28592`, and `cp28595`
  resolved there while raising `LookupError` elsewhere -- text in those
  pages decoded correctly on one platform and became latin-1 mojibake
  on another.  `_CODEPAGE_ALIASES` now maps 30 Windows code-page
  identifiers (Macintosh, KOI8, the ISO-8859 family, ISO-2022, EUC, GB,
  UTF-7, GB18030) to portable Python codec names and is consulted
  first, so every platform resolves identically.  Found by the new
  cross-OS CI job on its first run; two tests now assert portability
  against the pure-Python codec registry so a regression fails on every
  platform rather than only the affected one.
- **Unresolvable code pages failed silently** (issue #12).  Falling back
  to latin-1 now emits a `UserWarning` instead of quietly producing
  mojibake that survives round-trip checks.
- **ANSI and Unicode dir records are reconciled** (issue #12).  When a
  module's name, stream name, or doc string disagrees between its ANSI
  record and its UTF-16 partner, the Unicode record -- lossless by
  construction -- is now authoritative.

### Added

- **20-language code-page test matrix** (issue #13, ported from
  `xlide_vscode`): one native-language sample per supported code page,
  each asserting zero substitution bytes on encode, an NFC-normalized
  round trip, and a full write -> read -> list -> validate cycle on a
  workbook whose PROJECTCODEPAGE is that page, plus native-language
  module names for cp1251 / cp932 / cp936.  The zero-substitution
  assertion is the load-bearing one: with `errors="replace"` a wall of
  `?` round-trips happily.  Fixtures are generated by patching one
  template's dir record, so no per-language binaries are committed.
- **Dedicated cross-OS `languages` CI job** running that matrix on
  ubuntu and windows, mirroring the equivalent job in the port, so a
  code-page regression names its own OS.
- Live Excel gate case for a Cyrillic-named module (opt-in via
  `RUN_LIVE_EXCEL=1`).

## [3.3.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- **Excel fixture CI on real Office** (#4, contributed by
  @DecimalTurn): a Windows workflow that builds fixture workbooks with
  the checked-out pyOpenVBA (no Office needed for the build), installs
  Excel on the runner via the SHA-pinned `DecimalTurn/setup-vba`
  action, runs each fixture's macro over COM, verifies its sentinel
  output, and uploads a desktop screenshot on failure.  Path-filtered
  to fixture and harness changes.  Complements the local
  `RUN_LIVE_EXCEL` gate with per-PR live-Office coverage -- the
  `with_class` fixture is a genuine VBE-export-form class module, so
  the issue #1 bug class is now regression-tested on real Excel in CI.
- **`ExcelFile.create_new` supports `.xlam`** (Excel add-in), joining
  `.xlsm` and `.xlsb`.  The baked-in template is captured from a
  freshly Excel-authored add-in (`ThisWorkbook`, `Sheet1`, bare
  `Module1`) via the new `scripts/bake_xlam_template.py`, following
  the existing bake pattern.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-01

### Changed

- **Decompression is 1.76x faster, byte-for-byte identical** (issue #5).
  `decompress` now emits output with slice operations wherever the spec
  allows -- non-overlapping copy tokens move as one slice, runs of
  literal tokens within a flag byte extend once -- and recomputes the
  copy-token masks only when the chunk-local output size crosses a
  power of two.  Overlapping copies keep the spec's byte-at-a-time
  semantics.  Measured 12.4 -> 21.8 MB/s across the 31 module and dir
  streams in the live fixtures; new oracle-equivalence tests pin the
  optimized decoder against the original per-byte implementation,
  including identical error messages and offsets on malformed input.
- **Module source loads lazily** (issue #5).  Decompressing module
  source is 88-96% of the cost of opening a project, so
  `parse_vba_project` now decompresses only the first chunk of each
  module stream (enough for the `Attribute VB_*` header; for
  single-chunk modules it already is the whole source) and defers the
  rest until the first `VBAModule.source` access.  Stream lookup and
  MODULEOFFSET bounds checks stay eager.  Opening the large-module
  fixture for `module_names()` drops from 1.47 ms to 0.79 ms.  Two
  visible consequences: a corrupt chunk past the first one raises
  `VBAProjectError` at first access instead of at parse time, and
  `VBAModule` is now a regular class rather than a dataclass -- the
  constructor signature is unchanged, a new `source_loaded` property
  reports materialization, but dataclass-generated field equality and
  repr are gone (equality is identity).

### Added

- `decompress(..., max_bytes=N)` stops at the first chunk boundary at
  or beyond N output bytes and returns the chunk-aligned prefix.  Copy
  tokens never cross chunk boundaries (the decoder enforces it), so
  the prefix is byte-identical to the same range of a full
  decompression.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- **Class modules built from VBE-exported `.cls` sources now compile in
  the host** (GitHub issue #1). `add_module(kind=VBAModuleKind.other)`,
  `set_module`, and `push_modules` normalize class sources from
  file-export form to stream form via the new
  `pyopenvba.vba.normalize_class_source()`: a leading
  `VERSION 1.0 CLASS` / `BEGIN` / `END` preamble is stripped, and
  `Attribute VB_Base` is inserted after `VB_Name` when missing.  On
  replacement of an existing module the prior header's `VB_Base` line is
  preserved, so document-module host CLSIDs are never overwritten.
  Previously a supplied header was written into the stream verbatim: a
  missing `VB_Base` made Excel raise "Invalid procedure call or
  argument" at the first `New` site, and a VERSION preamble in the
  stream raised "Compile error: Expected: end of statement" (both
  verified against live Excel, as is the fix).  Supersedes the 2.0.1
  guidance that callers must supply the `VB_Base` line themselves.
- `pyopenvba.__version__` reported 2.0.0 while PyPI shipped 3.0.x.  A
  new test pins it to the installed package metadata so the two sources
  cannot drift again.
- CFB `get_stream_in_storage` / `write_stream_in_storage` /
  `list_streams_in_storage` now operate on the named storage's own
  child subtree instead of linear-scanning the whole directory.  The
  old scan could read or overwrite a same-named stream in a different
  storage (two UserForms both carry `o` / `f` streams) and reported
  root-level streams as members of every storage.  The host facades now
  address `PROJECTwm` at the project root, where [MS-OVBA] 2.2.1 puts
  it.  Byte output for well-formed files is unchanged (verified by
  hashing a 25-case save matrix across all live fixtures).
- `python -m pyopenvba pull / push / ls` now route Word and PowerPoint
  files by extension instead of assuming Excel; legacy `.xls` / `.doc`
  / `.ppt` are accepted everywhere the modern extensions are.  `disasm`
  no longer advertises `.xltm` / `.ppam`, which no facade accepts.
- `python -m pyopenvba access-pull` delegates to
  `AccessReader.pull_modules`, so Access class modules export as
  `.cls` (previously everything was written as `.bas`).
- README support section named the wrong project; roadmap.md's link to
  the feature-gate matrix pointed outside `docs/`.

### Changed

- The MS-OVBA compressor's LZ encoder uses a 3-gram position index
  instead of re-scanning the whole window at every position: about 60x
  faster on the 17 KB large-module fixture (0.44 s to 0.007 s) and
  0.4 s on a 1 MB input.  Output is byte-for-byte unchanged -- Access
  validates OVBA cache blobs against exact compressor output -- pinned
  by new naive-oracle equivalence tests across random, repetitive, and
  boundary inputs.
- `AccessReader.pull_modules` walks the database's LVAL rows once
  instead of four times per call.
- `save()` emits pending module additions and deletions in sorted
  order, making multi-add saves byte-deterministic across processes
  (Python randomizes set iteration per process via string hashing).
- `ExcelFile`, `WordFile`, and `PowerPointFile` are now thin subclasses
  of a single shared implementation
  (`pyopenvba._host.VBAHostFile`), removing three hand-synchronized
  copies of the read/edit/pull/push/save pipeline (~900 duplicated
  lines).  The public API is unchanged and the refactor was verified
  byte-identical against the previous implementation on every live
  fixture and save operation.

### Added

- **Live Excel compile-and-run gate** (`tests/test_live_excel_gate.py`
  plus `tools/live_excel/`): builds a workbook with an export-form
  class module, runs its macro in desktop Excel under a popup-aware
  bounded harness (VBE modals are dismissed, captured, and reported
  instead of deadlocking the run), and requires a clean run plus the
  macro's sentinel output.  Opt-in via `RUN_LIVE_EXCEL=1` on Windows;
  skipped in CI.  Issue #1 shipped because "opens without a repair
  prompt" was the strongest live verification; this gate closes that
  gap.
- CI matrix now tests Python 3.14 (the classifiers already claimed it).

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **`AccessReader`** (EXPERIMENTAL) -- pure-Python **read-only** support for
  Microsoft Access `.accdb` / `.mdb` (ACE / Jet 4) databases:
  - `AccessReader(path)` parses the 4 KiB page-layout file header and
    validates the ACE / Jet signature.
  - `iter_vba_modules()` yields every embedded VBA module (`VBAModule`
    dataclass with `name`, `start_offset`, `attributes_text`, `source`).
    Modules are discovered by scanning for MS-OVBA stream signatures and
    walking the LVAL page chains they live on -- no Access COM, no
    MSysObjects parser required.
  - `vba_module_names()` deduplicates shadow / undo copies and returns
    the live module name list.
  - `read_vba_module(name)` returns the user-visible source string with
    `\r\n` line endings preserved; matches Access COM
    `CodeModule.Lines()` output byte-for-byte (verified on a 1000-line
    Module + 1000-line Class + 500-line Module live fixture against an
    Access COM oracle).
  - Re-exported from `pyopenvba` as `AccessReader`.
  - Write path (re-compress + re-allocate LVAL pages) is not implemented;
    Access support is read-only by design.

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Renamed `pyopenvba.access` module to `pyopenvba.access_read`
  and renamed the `AccessFile` class to `AccessReader` to make the
  read-only access posture explicit.
- Adopted strict static analysis: pyright `typeCheckingMode = "strict"`
  and a curated ruff lint configuration (`E, F, W, B, UP, SIM, I, RUF,
  PIE, C4, PERF, N, TC, RET, TRY`) now run clean across `src/` and
  `tests/` with 0 errors.

### Removed

- Pruned ~1800 lines of dead Access write-path / probe code and the
  associated tests that exercised never-public APIs.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **`synthesize_class_header(name)`** -- new public helper (importable from
  `pyopenvba`) that returns the standard eight-line attribute header for a
  plain VBA class module, including the universal `VB_Base` CLSID. It is
  now also emitted automatically by `add_module(kind=VBAModuleKind.other)`
  when a bare body is supplied, matching the existing behaviour for standard
  modules. Callers no longer need to construct or hard-code the CLSID
  constant themselves.

### Fixed

- **README relative links were broken on PyPI.** The links to `LICENSE.md`,
  `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and
  `docs/ms-ovba-implementation-guide_v2.md` were relative paths that
  resolved correctly on GitHub but 404'd on the PyPI project page. All
  five occurrences are now absolute `github.com/blob/main/...` URLs.

### Changed

- Demo scripts (`create_new_excel_with_class_demo.py`,
  `create_new_with_class_demo.py`, `create_new_word_with_class_demo.py`,
  `inject_xlsb_with_class_demo.py`) updated to use the body-only
  `add_module` call, removing the manual `_CLASS_VB_BASE` constant and
  `DATAMODEL_HEADER` block.
- README Architecture section updated to include `synthesize_class_header`
  in the `__init__.py` public API listing.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-24

### Added

- **`WordFile`** -- full read/write support for Word macro-enabled files:
  `.docm`, `.dotm` (OOXML/ZIP), and legacy `.doc` (raw CFB/BIFF8).
  Exposes the same API as `ExcelFile`: `module_names()`, `get_module()`,
  `set_module()`, `vba_project()`, `save()`, `pull_modules()`,
  `push_modules()`.
- **`PowerPointFile`** -- full read/write support for PowerPoint
  macro-enabled files: `.pptm`, `.potm` (OOXML/ZIP), and legacy `.ppt`
  (raw CFB). Same API surface as `ExcelFile` and `WordFile`.
- **`WordFile.create_new(path)`** -- create a brand-new `.docm` from
  scratch without launching Word. Ships with `ThisDocument` and an empty
  `Module1`; opens cleanly with no repair prompt.
- **`PowerPointFile.create_new(path)`** -- create a brand-new `.pptm`
  from scratch without launching PowerPoint. Ships with an empty
  `Module1`; opens cleanly with no repair prompt.
- **`ExcelFile.create_new()` now supports `.xlsb`** in addition to
  `.xlsm`. The extension in the path controls which baked-in template is
  used.
- **`pull_word(document, dest_dir)`** / **`push_word(src_dir, document)`**
  -- disk-based pull/push helpers for Word, mirroring the Excel `pull()`
  / `push()` API.
- **`pull_ppt(presentation, dest_dir)`** / **`push_ppt(src_dir, presentation)`**
  -- disk-based pull/push helpers for PowerPoint.
- **`scripts/bake_xlsb_template.py`** -- bakes the empty `.xlsb` template
  blob into `_templates/__init__.py` using the same splice pattern as the
  docm/pptm bake scripts.
- Class module creation is now fully supported across all three hosts.
  When adding a class module via `add_module(kind=other)`, callers must
  supply the full attribute header including
  `Attribute VB_Base = "0{FCFB3D2A-A0FA-1068-A738-08002B3371B5}"` (the
  universal VBA class CLSID); without it Office raises "Invalid procedure
  call or argument" on instantiation.

### Changed

- `pyproject.toml` description updated to reflect all three supported
  Office hosts; `word`, `powerpoint`, `docm`, and `pptm` added to
  keywords.
- README fully updated: tagline, supported formats tables, 30-second tour,
  `create_new` section, and pull/push workflow section now cover Excel,
  Word, and PowerPoint.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Editing a document module's source via `set_module()` (e.g. `ThisWorkbook`,
  `Sheet1`) silently broke the workbook in Excel.** The leading
  `Attribute VB_Name = "ThisWorkbook"` / `Attribute VB_Base = "..."` /
  `Attribute VB_PredeclaredId = True` header lines that bind a document
  module to its host object were being stripped on a source replacement.
  Excel then re-compiled the module without those bindings and either
  silently dropped the code or showed an empty module in the VBE.

### Added

- **VBE-style body-only source edits.** `ExcelFile.set_module(name, text)`
  now accepts either a full source replacement (text beginning with
  `Attribute VB_*` or `VERSION ... CLASS`) or a bare body. When a bare
  body is supplied, the module's existing attribute header is
  automatically re-prepended, matching the VBE UX where the user only
  types the executable code.
- **`VBAModule.body`** property: read or write a module's executable body
  without touching its attribute header.
- **`VBAModule.attribute_header`** field: the contiguous leading
  `VERSION ... CLASS` block + `Attribute VB_*` lines + separator,
  captured at parse time.
- **`split_attribute_header(source) -> (header, body)`** public helper.
- **`add_module(name, body, kind=standard)` now synthesizes a minimal
  `Attribute VB_Name = "<name>"` header** when the caller doesn't supply
  one. Caller-supplied headers are passed through unchanged.
- **`add_module(kind=other)` requires an explicit attribute header.**
  pyOpenVBA refuses to invent class or document module headers since
  their host-binding metadata can't be safely guessed.
- **`rename_module()` re-keys the in-source `Attribute VB_Name = "..."`
  line** to the new logical name so the source matches the dir-stream
  binding.
- New `TestAttributeHeaderPreservation` test class covering:
  header splitting (standard, document, class, headerless),
  `set_module` body-only preservation on a document module,
  `set_module` full-source replacement,
  `add_module` header synthesis vs. caller-supplied,
  `add_module(kind=other)` rejection without a header,
  and the `VBAModule.body` property round-trip.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- **`ExcelFile.create_new(path)`** -- create a brand-new macro-enabled
  workbook from scratch in pure Python, without ever launching Excel.
  The new file ships with a fresh VBA project containing `ThisWorkbook`,
  `Sheet1`, and an empty `Module1`, opens cleanly in Excel with no
  "found a problem with some content" repair prompt, and is ready for
  immediate edits via the normal `vba_project()` / `save()` flow.
- New `TestExcelFileCreateNew` test class covering write-out, expected
  modules, empty `Module1`, round-trip with user code, overwrite of an
  existing file, and creation of missing parent directories.

### Internal

- New `src/pyopenvba/_templates/__init__.py` module embedding a
  byte-for-byte clone of a freshly Excel-authored empty `.xlsm` as a
  zlib-compressed base85 constant. No binary fixtures are shipped in the
  wheel; the template is regenerated by `scripts/bake_empty_template.py`
  from `tests/live_excel_testing/freshly_touched.xlsm`.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Excel rejected modules whose source spanned more than one 4 KB chunk**
  with *"An error occurred while loading <Module>"*. The MS-OVBA compressor
  was emitting raw (CompressedChunkFlag = 0) chunks for full 4096-byte
  blocks. Although spec-legal, Office itself never writes raw chunks for
  module source streams -- empirically confirmed against an Excel-authored
  workbook containing a 16,881-byte module (all five of its chunks were
  token-compressed). The compressor now always emits token-compressed
  (flag = 1) chunks for module source; raw chunks remain only as a fallback
  for adversarial 4096-byte high-entropy input that overflows LZ encoding.
- **Re-running an add-module workflow after a delete produced duplicate
  `PROJECT` entries**, which Excel treats as corruption. Calling
  `add_module(name, ...)` after `delete_module(name)` in the same save now
  cancels the pending delete and treats the operation as a source rewrite,
  matching Excel's own behaviour. `serialize_project_stream` additionally
  scrubs duplicate `Module=` and workspace declarations on every structural
  save, healing files that were corrupted by earlier versions.

### Added

- `demo/` folder containing a runnable end-to-end demo
  (`push_demo_module.py` + `test_macro_workbook.xlsm` + `demo.md`).
- New regression tests:
  - `TestCompress.test_full_chunk_emitted_as_token_compressed_not_raw` and
    `TestCompress.test_long_module_round_trip_through_excel_save` verify
    that no raw chunks are produced for realistic VBA source.
  - `TestLargeModuleFixture` uses an Excel-authored 16 KB module as an
    empirical anchor and round-trips it through pyOpenVBA's saver.
  - `test_delete_then_readd_same_name_does_not_duplicate_project_decl` and
    `test_save_heals_preexisting_duplicate_project_declarations` cover the
    PROJECT-stream fix.
- `tests/live_excel_testing/large_vba_module.xlsm` fixture (Excel-authored
  reference for multi-chunk module compression).

## [1.0.0] - 2026

Initial public release. Pure-Python read/write support for VBA projects
inside `.xlsm`, `.xlsb`, and `.xls` containers, covering CFB parsing,
MS-OVBA compression, module add/edit/rename/delete, `PROJECT`/`PROJECTwm`
serialization, `_VBA_PROJECT` cache invalidation, and round-trip
preservation including password-protected projects.
